 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on U.S. Airstrikes in Houthi-Controlled Areas of Yemen",
 "text": "Today, U.S. military forces, including U.S. Air Force B-2 bombers, conducted precision strikes against five hardened underground weapons storage locations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. U.S. forces targeted several of the Houthis' underground facilities housing various weapons components of types that the Houthis have used to target civilian and military vessels throughout the region. This was a unique demonstration of the United States' ability to target facilities that our adversaries seek to keep out of reach, no matter how deeply buried underground, hardened, or fortified. The employment of U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit long-range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere. For over a year, the Iran-backed Houthis, Specially Designated Global Terrorists, have recklessly and unlawfully attacked U.S. and international vessels transiting the Red Sea, the Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis' illegal attacks continue to disrupt the free flow of international commerce, threaten environmental catastrophe, and put innocent civilian lives and U.S. and partner forces' lives at risk. At the direction of President Biden, I authorized these targeted strikes to further degrade the Houthis' capability to continue their destabilizing behavior and to protect and defend U.S. forces and personnel in one of the world's most critical waterways. Again, the United States will not hesitate to take action to defend American lives and assets; to deter attacks against civilians and our regional partners; and to protect freedom of navigation and increase the safety and security in these waterways for U.S., coalition, and merchant vessels. We will continue to make clear to the Houthis that there will be consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks. I am grateful for the professionalism and skill of the brave American troops who took part in today's actions and who continue to stand guard in defense of our Nation. Defense Secretary middle east Houthis Austin"

 "text": "America's greatest national-security asset is the brave and qualified patriots who step up to form our all-volunteer force. Brave LGBTQ+ Americans have long volunteered to serve the country that they love. Some of these troops were administratively separated from military service under the now-repealed \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. Under President Biden's leadership, the Department of Defense has taken extraordinary steps to redress the harms done by \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and other policies on these former Service members. Just over a year ago, I announced that the Department would, for the first time, begin to proactively review the military records of former Service members discharged during \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" because of their sexual orientation who might have been eligible for upgrades to the characterization of their discharge or changes to their reason for separation but had not yet applied. After a year of exceptional work, the Military Department Review Boards directed relief in 96.8% of the 851 cases that they proactively reviewed. What this means is that of the nearly 13,500 individuals who were administratively separated under Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, and served long enough to receive a merit-based characterization of service, 96% now have an honorable discharge. We will continue to honor the service and the sacrifice of all our troops including the brave Americans who raised their hands to serve but were turned away because of whom they love. We will continue to strive to do right by every American patriot who has honorably served their country. Link: Spotlight: Don't Ask, Don't Tell Resources Austin Defense Secretary lgbtq community"

 "text": "At the direction of the President, Secretary Austin authorized the deployment of a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and associated crew of U.S. military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel's air defenses following Iran's unprecedented attacks against Israel on April 13 and again on October 1. The THAAD Battery will augment Israel's integrated air defense system. This action underscores the United States' ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel, and to defend Americans in Israel, from any further ballistic missile attacks by Iran. It is part of the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months, to support the defense of Israel and protect Americans from attacks by Iran and Iranian-aligned militias. This is not the first time the United States has deployed a THAAD battery to the region. The President directed the military to deploy a THAAD battery to the Middle East last year following the October 7th attacks to defend American troops and interests in the region. The United States previously deployed a THAAD battery to Israel in 2019 for training and an integrated air defense exercise. israel support Defense Secretary Austin"

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III Marking One Year Since Hamas's October 7th Terrorist Assault on the State of Israel",
 "text": "A year ago today, on October 7, 2023, Hamas perpetrated the worst terrorist attack in Israel's history. On the Jewish holy day of Simchat Torah, Hamas murdered some 1,200 civilians, including more than 40 American citizens, and took 251 more innocent people hostage, including 12 Americans. One year after the bloodiest day in Jewish history since the end of the Holocaust, we mourn with the people of Israel and with the families of those slain by Hamas and we stand with the families still working with such courage to free their loved ones from Hamas captivity. The Department of Defense's primary duty is to keep American citizens safe. We bow our heads in memory of the Americans murdered by Hamas over the past year, including the slain hostages Itay Chen, Gad Haggai, Judy Weinstein Haggai, and Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Their memories will be a blessing and spur us to action. We will not rest until every hostage has returned home. The atrocities Hamas committed on October 7th are a stark reminder of the threat posed by Hamas and other terrorist organizations backed by Iran. At the direction of President Biden, the Department has surged security assistance to Israel since October 7th and has deployed additional military forces to the Middle East to support the defense of Israel; to deter further aggression from Iran and its partners and proxies; and to protect U.S. personnel across the region. On April 13 and again on October 1, U.S. forces coordinated with the Israel Defense Forces and other partners to defeat Iran's brazen and outrageous ballistic-missile, cruise-missile, and UAV barrages against Israel. The Department has also supported other U.S. government agencies working to free the hostages and to surge humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Hamas is a ruthless terrorist group that uses civilians as shields. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed in Gaza. All states have a duty to respond to a terrorist outrage like October 7th and all states have a duty to protect civilians during armed conflict. Over the past year, I have often discussed with Israel's leaders how protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative. We mourn the death of every Palestinian civilian killed in the West Bank and Gaza during this awful conflict, and we grieve for the deaths of the American citizens Tawfiq Ajaq, Mohammad Khdour, and Aysenur Eygi. It would compound this year of tragedy if all that awaited Israelis and Palestinians was more insecurity, bitterness, and despair ahead. Like every U.S. administration since the Six-Day War of 1967, we believe that Israelis and Palestinians must find a way to share the land that they both call home. That means working to find a path toward two states, living side by side in mutual security, as part of a broader, brighter future of Arab-Israeli normalization that includes Israel's integration into the region. The Department of Defense will not flinch in our commitment to Israel's security, to combatting terrorism by Hamas and other fanatical groups, to deterring further aggression from Iran, and to working with our allies and partners to promote stability and peace in the Middle East. My prayers today are with those murdered by Hamas on October 7th, with the survivors, and with all who are still working courageously to bring their loved ones home and end the suffering by reaching a ceasefire deal that will bring the hostages home and enable a surge of humanitarian aid. This is not just a day to mourn. It is a day to work. hamas middle east Central Command Austin Defense Secretary israel"

The DOD is confident that the negotiations between the two countries has resulted in an agreement that will protect the long-term, secure, and effective operation of the joint U.S.-UK military base on Diego Garcia.

This agreement will safeguard the strategic security interests of the United Kingdom, Mauritius, and the United States, as well as our partners in the Indo-Pacific region into the next century. The Department of Defense reaffirms the special defense relationship with the United Kingdom and looks forward to advancing a strategic defense partnership with Mauritius.

We will never hesitate to protect our forces and interests in the Middle East, and to support the defense of Israel and our partners in the region. I am deeply proud of the skill and the bravery of the U.S. troops who helped to save lives today from Iran's assault and who continue to support Israel's defense and to prevent a widening conflict or escalation. Our forces remain postured to protect U.S. troops and partners in the Middle East, and the Department maintains significant capability to defend our people, provide further support for Israel's self-defense, and deter further escalation.

 "text": "Secretary Austin has been receiving updates from and providing guidance to his team throughout the weekend on the latest developments in the Middle East. He and DoD leaders remain focused on the protection of U.S. citizens and forces in the region, the defense of Israel, and the de-escalation of the situation through deterrence and diplomacy. Secretary Austin stressed that the United States is determined to prevent Iran and Iranian-backed partners and proxies from exploiting the situation or expanding the conflict. Secretary Austin made clear that should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every necessary measure to defend our people. The United States retains the capability to deploy forces on short notice. The Department of Defense continues to maintain a significant amount of capability in the region and to dynamically adjust our force posture based on the evolving security situation. The Secretary has directed that the USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN Carrier Strike Group (CSG) remain in the USCENTCOM theater and that the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready Group / Marine Expeditionary Unit (ARG/MEU) will continue to operate in the Eastern Mediterranean. This afloat posture is complemented by DoD s elevated fighter and attack squadron presence, including F-22, F-15E, F-16, and A-10 aircraft, and we will further reinforce our defensive air-support capabilities in the coming days. The Secretary has also increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies. And DoD maintains robust and integrated air-defense capabilities across the Middle East, ensuring the protection of U.S. forces operating in the region.

 "text": "While I am pleased that the passage of another Continuing Resolution (CR) has averted another government shutdown, which would have had a dire impact on the Department of Defense and our brave troops, the stark truth is that these short-term, temporary funding measures create uncertainty throughout the U.S. military and put us at a strategic disadvantage. A lack of long-term funding delays missions, undermines readiness, and inflicts unnecessary disruptions on our military families and recruitment efforts. Furthermore, functioning under a CR impedes military readiness and makes it impossible in most cases to begin or accelerate new programs. Our strategic competitors' militaries do not have to work under CRs. To ensure the U.S. military remains prepared to meet the national-security challenges of today's complex world, and to ensure sustained American competitiveness and leadership, I urge Congress to reach a bipartisan agreement on FY 2025 appropriations this fall. As I have said before, that is not only the right thing to do, but also the best thing that Congress can do to keep our country strong and secure. Austin Defense Secretary budget fy25 budget"

The principals committed to work together and with other partners, including the private sector, to explore mechanisms to stimulate greater demand for minerals that are produced in accordance with high ESG standards.

The principals emphasized that Australia and the United States share great interest in achieving peace and stability in the Middle East and underscored the urgent need to de-escalate tensions across the region. They reiterated their condemnation of Hamas's horrific terrorist attacks on October 7. They welcomed UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) S/RES/2735 (2024) and affirmed the imperative of securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and strongly urged all parties to work towards an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza. The principals underscored the urgent need to significantly increase deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. They also emphasized the need for all parties to adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians and humanitarian workers. They reiterated that terrorism, the large-scale loss of civilian lives, and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza are all unacceptable. The principals remain committed to a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state taking into account Israel's legitimate security concerns as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting and secure peace.

Austin III, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Japan Minister of Defense Kihara Minoru, and Japan Minister for Foreign Affairs Kamikawa Yoko resolved to enhance U.S.-Japan Alliance deterrence and response capabilities to uphold the free and open rules-based international order. Following Japan Prime Minister Kishida Fumio's Official Visit to Washington, D.C., on April 10, 2024, the Secretary and his counterparts underscored bilateral progress to build a global partnership for the future, including by upgrading Alliance command and control (C2), deepening defense industry and advanced technology cooperation, and enhancing cross-domain operations. During the 2+2 meeting, they reaffirmed their intent to accelerate the following lines of effort. Modernize Alliance Roles, Missions, and Capabilities The United States and Japan decided to upgrade the core tenets of the Alliance to reflect their historic level of bilateral interoperability and to meet challenges posed to their shared vision and common values. The Ministers announced a historic decision to modernize U.S. and Japanese command and control (C2) frameworks, including the reconstitution of U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) to a Joint Force Headquarters, which will complement Japan's establishment of the JSDF Joint Operations Command (JJOC). The JJOC will increase Japan's joint operations capability and facilitate greater interoperability with U.S. forces. The decision to reconstitute USFJ to expand its missions and operational responsibilities will be the most significant change to USFJ since its creation and one of the strongest improvements to the Alliance's military cooperation in seventy years. The Ministers welcomed initiatives to strengthen bilateral training, exercises, and operations, as well as initiatives to bolster the Alliance's presence in Japan's Southwest Islands. The Ministers reiterated U.S. defense commitments under Article V of the Mutual Security Treaty, including nuclear, and Japan's role in maintaining peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region by seamlessly responding to any situation from peacetime to contingency, further enabled by Japan's 2015 Legislation for Peace and Security.

 "text": "Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Defense Austin, Minister for Foreign Affairs KAMIKAWA, and Minister of Defense KIHARA (referred to collectively as \"the Ministers\") convened the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (SCC) in Tokyo, Japan, on July 28, 2024. Recognizing the profound level of global threats to our Alliance's shared vision and common values, the Ministers affirmed the enduring U.S. and Japanese commitment to stand shoulder-to-shoulder in upholding and protecting the free and open international order based on the rule of law, and to redouble our work with allies and partners in furtherance of this goal. The Ministers reiterated the importance of the U.S.-Japan Alliance as the cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The Ministers confirmed steady progress in implementing both countries' national strategic documents and in holding intensive consultations on Alliance roles and missions to further strengthen deterrence and response capabilities. The Ministers reaffirmed their intent to implement new strategic initiatives following Prime Minister KISHIDA's historic Official Visit with State Dinner on April 10, with the vision to build a global partnership for the future, including upgrading Alliance command and control (C2), deepening defense industry and advanced technology cooperation, and enhancing cross-domain operations. Given the increasingly severe security environment caused by recent moves of regional actors, the United States restated its unwavering commitment to the defense of Japan under Article V of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear. Japan reaffirmed its steadfast dedication to reinforce its own defense capabilities and to enhance its close coordination with the United States. In line with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the U.S.-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation, Japan reaffirmed its role in maintaining peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region by seamlessly responding to any situation from peacetime to contingencies. This has been further enabled by Japan's 2015 Legislation for Peace and Security, which enhances U.S.-Japan Alliance deterrence and response capabilities. The United States welcomed Japan's reinforcement of its defense capabilities, including the sustained increase in its defense budget, the creation of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) Joint Operations Command (JJOC), the focus on cybersecurity, and the possession of counterstrike capabilities. Acknowledging the evolving security environment and the challenges posed to the Alliance today and in the future, the Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The Ministers concurred that the People's Republic of China (PRC)'s foreign policy seeks to reshape the international order for its own benefit at the expense of others. They highlighted that the PRC employs political, economic, and military coercion of countries, companies, and civil society, as well as facilitates its military modernization through the diversion of technology to achieve these objectives. Such behavior is a serious concern to the Alliance and the entire international community and represents the greatest strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The Ministers reiterated their strong opposition to the PRC's intensifying attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea, including through actions that seek to undermine Japan's longstanding and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands, as well as escalatory behavior around the Southwest Islands. The United States reaffirmed that Article V of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security applies to the Senkaku Islands. They shared their continuing concerns regarding the PRC's ongoing and rapid expansion of its nuclear weapons arsenal, which continues without any transparency regarding its intent and which the PRC refuses to acknowledge, despite publicly available evidence. The Ministers reiterated their strong objections to the PRC's unlawful maritime claims, militarization of reclaimed features, and threatening and provocative activities in the South China Sea. The PRC's destabilizing actions in this region include unsafe encounters at sea and in the air, efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resources exploitation, as well as the dangerous use of Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels. The Ministers reaffirmed full respect for international law, including freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea as reflected in the relevant provisions of the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS). They emphasized that the July 12, 2016, Award in the South China Sea Arbitration (The Republic of Philippines v. The PRC), constituted under UNCLOS, is final and legally binding on the parties to that proceeding. The Ministers reaffirmed their serious concern over the PRC's repeated obstruction of Philippine vessels' exercise of high seas freedom of navigation and the disruption of supply lines to Second Thomas Shoal, which constitute dangerous and destabilizing conduct. The Ministers resolved to work with partners in Southeast Asia, based on their unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity, to support regional maritime security and uphold international law. The Ministers stated that their basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged and reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community. They encouraged cross-Strait issues be resolved peacefully. The Ministers emphasized Taiwan's political transition period should not be used as a pretext for provocative actions across the Taiwan Strait. They expressed serious concerns about the dismantling of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms as well as the PRC's human rights issues, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. The Ministers strongly condemned North Korea's continued conduct of reckless ballistic missile launches, alarming in number, in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs) and at the cost of the welfare of people in North Korea. The Ministers also condemned North Korea's continued nuclear weapons program and nuclear rhetoric and reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of North Korea, urging North Korea to abide by all its obligations under relevant UNSCRs and engage in substantive dialogue. The Ministers urged all UN Member States to ensure full and effective implementation of all UNSCRs related to North Korea, and reaffirmed close cooperation in exploring ways to ensure implementation. The Ministers confirmed the need for an immediate resolution of the abductions issue. The Ministers strongly condemned Russia's brutal, unprovoked, and unjustifiable war against Ukraine. They recognized that Russia's violation of the UN Charter and its attempts to unilaterally change borders by force through its ongoing aggression against Ukraine present a clear challenge to the international order, with global impacts including on the Indo-Pacific. The Ministers condemned Russia's reckless nuclear rhetoric and its attacks against critical infrastructure, and they reiterated the need for Russia to be held accountable for its atrocities in Ukraine. They also highlighted with concern Russia's growing and provocative strategic military cooperation with the PRC, including through joint operations and drills in the vicinity of Japan, and the PRC's support for Russia's defense industrial base. The Ministers strongly condemned deepening Russia-North Korea cooperation, exemplified by Russia's procurement of ballistic missiles and other materiel from North Korea in direct violation of UNSCRs for use against Ukraine, and expressed deep concern about the potential for transfer of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or ballistic missile-related technology and expertise to North Korea, which would deteriorate regional stability and further undermine the global non-proliferation regime. They underscored that Russia's and North Korea's actions have a destabilizing impact on global and Indo-Pacific security. The Ministers underscored that the outcome of the recent Russia-North Korea Summit, including the signing of the \"Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,\" should be of grave concern in the interest of maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, upholding the global non-proliferation regime, and supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia's brutal aggression. The Ministers shared the recognition that instability in the Middle East reverberates across the international community, impacting Indo-Pacific security and economies. They condemned Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and surrounding waterways that threaten the regional and global economy and cause delivery delays and price increases for badly needed food and medicine. The Ministers remained committed to seeing a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, and a negotiated two-State solution that resolves the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict with an independent Palestinian state with Israel's security guaranteed, enabling both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace. U.S.-Japan Deterrence and Response Capabilities Building upon the past year's achievements and the unprecedented alignment of both countries' national strategic documents, the Ministers emphasized the United States and Japan will further enhance Alliance deterrence and response capabilities to meet the challenges posed by the evolving security environment, focusing on the following areas: 1. Upgrading Alliance Coordination, Command and Control The Ministers affirmed the need to strengthen Alliance policy and operational coordination at all levels through exercise and discussion, and to foster a shared understanding of Alliance processes from peacetime through contingencies. To facilitate deeper interoperability and cooperation on joint bilateral operations in peacetime and during contingencies, the United States intends to reconstitute U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) as a joint force headquarters (JFHQ) reporting to the Commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM). This reconstituted USFJ is intended to serve as an important JJOC counterpart. Through a phased approach, USFJ would enhance its capabilities and operational cooperation with the JJOC, as well as assume primary responsibility for coordinating security activities in and around Japan in accordance with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security. In coordination and consultation with the U.S. Congress, the Department of Defense intends to reconstitute USFJ, in parallel with the development of the JJOC. The United States and Japan will closely consult and establish working groups to further develop bilateral aspects of this proposal, building upon the following shared C2 principles. In line with the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security and the U.S.-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation, the United States and Japan will upgrade respective C2 frameworks in support of the security of Japan and the maintenance of international peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. The United States and Japan will enhance interoperability at the policy-level by coordinating respective decision-making processes, and at the operational-level by coordinating plans, capability development and employment, posture, resource allocation, and exercises. This includes facilitating greater interoperability on joint bilateral operations, such as: intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) activities, training and exercises; operational planning; contingency planning; and logistics. The United States and Japan will clearly define relationships between U.S. and Japanese C2 structures, taking into account Japan's establishment of the JJOC, with a focus on aligning missions, capabilities, and responsibilities between counterparts. In line with the U.S.-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation, the United States and Japan will ensure that the existing Alliance Coordination Mechanism remains the mechanism that facilities bilateral policy and operational coordination related to activities conducted by the United States Armed Forces and the Self-Defense Forces in all phases from peacetime to contingencies. The United States and Japan recognize the importance of strong cyber and information security, as well as information sharing, for realizing deeper interoperability, and will consider enhancing information sharing opportunities; further improving cyber, data, and information security; and enhancing communications and physical security. 2. Improving Alliance stand-off defense capabilities The Ministers welcomed Japan's advances in developing stand-off defense capabilities and highlighted progress on U.S.-Japan cooperation towards the effective operation of Japanese counterstrike capabilities in close coordination with the United States. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to accelerate cooperation on Japan's acquisition of Tomahawk, including on ship refurbishment and personnel training, to support Japan's operational capability. The Ministers also highlighted cooperation on stand-off missile procurements, including Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles with Extended Range (JASSM-ER). They welcomed further cooperation on Japan's development of its indigenous stand-off missiles, including the provision of U.S. materiel and technological support. 3. Bolstering Alliance activities in Japan's Southwest Islands The Ministers welcomed Japan's efforts to improve JSDF capabilities in the Southwest Islands by deploying additional units. To demonstrate Japan's resolve to strengthen its own defense capabilities and their mutual commitment to the security of Japan, the Ministers reaffirmed the Alliance's goal to increase bilateral presence in Japan's Southwest Islands. Japan's own efforts in the Southwest Islands, combined with Alliance exercises, training, posture, and other defense-related activities, enhance Alliance deterrence and response capabilities in this critical region. The Ministers underscored the importance of continued coordination with local communities of the region for these efforts, including support for strong relationships with them through enhanced communication about the importance of Alliance activities. 4. Strengthening bilateral exercises, readiness, and operations To maintain and enhance Alliance readiness, which underpins the credibility of Alliance deterrence, the Ministers affirmed bilateral efforts to advance planning for contingencies, as well as improve and expand the scope of realistic cross-domain training, tabletop exercises, and exercises, such as Resolute Dragon, Orient Shield, Yama Sakura, Keen Edge, Keen Sword, and Resilient Shield. The Ministers underscored the importance of continued discussion to improve the resiliency and smooth deployment of U.S. and Japanese defense assets, as well as their operational effectiveness during disaster responses and during a contingency, including through flexible access to air and seaports, and other operational foundations. They supported exploring further opportunities for Alliance exercises and joint/shared use of facilities throughout Japan, including in the Southwest Islands. The Ministers also welcomed the establishment and first meeting of Working Group for Future Fighter Training and Readiness (WG-FFTR), which will explore opportunities for future fighter pilot training and readiness, including AI and advanced simulators, and co-development and co-production of cutting-edge technologies such as common jet trainers to maintain combat-ready next-generation fighter airpower. 5. Enhancing extended deterrence As the Alliance faces a severe strategic and nuclear environment, the Ministers stressed the critical importance of continuing to enhance U.S. extended deterrence, bolstered by Japan's defense capabilities, as well as strengthening cooperation on extended deterrence and escalation management primarily through the Extended Deterrence Dialogue. Signifying the commitment to deepen substantive strategic-level discussions, the Ministers held the first ministerial-level meeting on extended deterrence. 6. Deepening ISR Cooperation The Ministers confirmed steady progress in ISR cooperation, which improves bilateral maritime domain awareness, facilitates timely information sharing and intelligence collection, bolsters Alliance deterrence, and provides the foundation for effective Alliance coordination, command, and control. In this context, they welcomed achievements of the Bilateral Information Analysis Cell (BIAC) and concurred to enhance and expand the BIAC through continued discussion on future cooperative efforts. They reiterated the importance of the U.S. MQ-9 deployment to Kadena Air Base to support Alliance ISR cooperation. 7. Expanding cooperation on cross-domain operations, information warfare, and artificial intelligence (AI) The Ministers committed to strengthening bilateral coordination on cross-domain operations, including cyber, space, and electromagnetic warfare (EW), recognizing the importance of all these domains to future concepts of deterrence and response capabilities. The Ministers welcomed cooperation on space capabilities, including a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) detection and tracking constellation for strategic threats such as long-range missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles, as well as bilateral and multilateral space cooperation including within the Combined Space Operations (CSpO) initiative since December 2023. They also highlighted deepening discussions on EW between the U.S. Department of Defense and Japanese Ministry of Defense, and welcomed the establishment of the EW Working Group between the U.S. Department of Defense and Japanese Ministry of Defense. Recognizing the threats to global stability via malign influence operations and grey zone activities, the Ministers supported the addition of information warfare as a topic for further cooperation to counter these looming threats and welcomed the establishment of the Information Warfare Synchronization Working Group between the U.S. Department of Defense and Japanese Ministry of Defense. On AI, the Ministers underlined the critical bilateral work to promote the responsible use of AI in the military domain, particularly through the AI Partnership for Defense (AIPfD) and the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of AI and Autonomy. 8. Strengthening cyber and information security The Ministers emphasized the foundational importance of cyber and information security for the Alliance and its ability to develop future-oriented capabilities, as well as stay ahead of growing cyber threats. They committed to deep cooperation on cyber and information security through incorporating Zero Trust Architecture to build resilience in the information and communication technology domain. The Ministers concurred on the importance of enhancing the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, and discussed promoting closer cooperation in U.S.-Japan defensive cyberspace operations to respond to threats for further strengthening alliance deterrence. The United States welcomed Japan's efforts to bolster its national cybersecurity posture, including Japan's steady implementation of its Risk Management Framework, which will help realize better network defense for information sharing with Japan. The Ministers discussed increasing opportunities for incorporating cyber defense concepts in future exercises. They applauded significant progress made through bilateral cyber and information security consultations. 9. Realizing shared goals with likeminded allies and partners The United States and Japan are leveraging our global partnership to network with likeminded countries that share the Alliance's goal to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific and uphold the free and open international order based on the rule of law. The Ministers reaffirmed the U.S.-Japan Alliance is at the core of both countries' efforts to deepen and expand multilateral cooperation on posture, capabilities, exercises, maritime domain awareness, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR), and other areas to enhance regional deterrence. The Ministers renewed their commitment to further advance the Alliance's partnership with Australia, leveraging the Japan-Australia Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) and in line with recent commitments at the May 2024 Trilateral Defense Ministerial Meeting (TDMM). The Ministers discussed key areas of cooperation, including on reciprocal deployments of U.S., Japanese, and Australian F-35s; ISR capabilities and exercises; increasing Japan's participation in U.S.-Australia force posture cooperation activities; pursuing networked air and missile defense architecture and exercises; and technology development through the recently signed trilateral Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDT&E) Memorandum of Arrangement. The Ministers welcomed the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) partners' consideration of cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects and looked forward to further discussions. The Ministers emphasized the critical importance of deepening cooperation with the Republic of Korea (ROK) to maintaining regional peace and stability, underpinned by the leadership commitments at the 2023 Camp David Summit and respective trilateral foreign and defense ministerial-level meetings this year. In support of these commitments, the Ministers hailed successful execution of the first iteration of the new, multi-domain trilateral exercise, FREEDOM EDGE, and the continued operation of a trilateral real-time Democratic People's Republic of Korea missile warning data sharing mechanism. The United States welcomed the signing of the Japan-Philippines RAA, and the Ministers looked forward to greater trilateral and multilateral cooperation on shared areas of interest, including maritime domain awareness and security, training and exercises with our respective forces, cooperation between our respective coast guards, capacity building, and HA/DR. They noted additional multilateral efforts including between the United States, Japan, the Philippines, and Australia to support capacity building for the Philippines. They lauded the April 2024 U.S.-Japan-Australia-Philippines and the June 2024 U.S.-Japan-Canada-Philippines maritime cooperative activities in the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone to strengthen the interoperability of our defense/armed forces' doctrines, tactics, techniques, and procedures, and uphold high seas freedoms in a manner consistent with the international law of the sea as reflected in UNCLOS. The Ministers underscored their strong support for ASEAN's unity and centrality. They also emphasized their support for the Pacific region's unity and its priorities as articulated through the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. They supported further cooperation with partners in Southeast Asia and Pacific Island Countries through joint training, capacity building, and assistance initiatives. Relatedly, the United States welcomed Japan's decision to establish the Official Security Assistance (OSA) framework to strengthen the security capacities and improve the deterrence capabilities of third countries, including the provision of coastal radar systems to the Philippines. The Ministers noted bilateral efforts to align U.S. initiatives with Japan's OSA. The Ministers reconfirmed the importance of the Quad, and their commitment to furthering the public goods Quad partners deliver to the region through the Indo-Pacific Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) and other initiatives. Highlighting the interconnected nature of security challenges in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions, the Ministers supported Japan's increased multilateral cooperation with NATO and cooperation throughout Europe. They confirmed efforts to align U.S. and Japanese strategic and diplomatic approaches toward each region through the recently launched U.S.-Japan Strategic Diplomacy and Development Dialogue. Defense Equipment and Technology Cooperation The Ministers reiterated the President and Prime Minister's aim to maximally align our economic, technology, and related strategies to advance innovation, strengthen our industrial bases, promote resilient and reliable supply chains, and build the strategic emerging industries of the future. They reaffirmed the importance of defense equipment and technology cooperation in enhancing Alliance capabilities, which underpins the Alliance's ability to support regional peace and stability. Through this cooperation, the United States and Japan are connecting acquisition, science, and technology ecosystems to maintain the technological edge, and cooperating on economic security measures to counter the weaponization of economic dependencies. The Ministers welcomed high-priority efforts to pursue mutually beneficial co-production opportunities to expand production capacity of Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) and Patriot PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) and meet critical demand for such advanced systems, address timely procurement and readiness requirements, and deter aggression. This includes the U.S. Interagency Missile Co-Production Working Group, led by the Deputy Secretary of State and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, which will inform the U.S.-Japan Forum on Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition, and Sustainment (DICAS). DICAS will focus on advancing missile co-production efforts as well as building supply chain resilience and facilitating ship and aircraft repair. Further, the Ministers supported senior U.S. and Japanese leadership attendance at the upcoming September 2024 Industry Day organized by Japanese Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency, which will provide opportunities to advance discussions on these key efforts. DICAS, in updating the SCC, and the U.S. Interagency Missile Co-Production Working Group will communicate with industry stakeholders to create the conditions required to co-produce advanced defensive systems. DICAS Missile Co-production Working Group participants will submit action plans for accelerating responsible technology release, promoting a viable business case, establishing programmatic timelines and required procurement quantities, and identifying funding mechanisms to the second DICAS meeting to be organized by the end of 2024. The Ministers further highlighted major arrangements signed recently, including the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) Project Arrangement, the Overwhelming Response through Collaborative Autonomy (ORCA) Project Arrangement, the High-Powered Microwave (HPM) Project Arrangement, and the Testing and Evaluation Program (TEP) Memorandum of Understanding. They echoed the role of the Defense Science and Technology Cooperation Group (DSTCG) in the bilateral technology cooperation and welcomed its second meeting this summer. The United States also commended Japan's future establishment of its new institute for defense innovation technology. Furthermore, they emphasized the importance of expanding bilateral cooperation on uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially joint research on RTA (runtime assurance) technology scheduled to start in the first half of 2025. The United States reiterated support for Japan's cooperation with like-minded countries on defense equipment and technology, including the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) with the United Kingdom and Italy, and the Ministers supported cooperation to ensure interoperability between GCAP and U.S. aircraft and uncrewed systems. The United States welcomed Japan's revision of its Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and its Implementation Guidelines, which supports efforts to leverage our respective industrial bases to meet the demand for critical capabilities. Under this revision, the United States further welcomed progress in transferring Japan's Patriot interceptor missiles to supplement U.S. stocks. To support further cooperation in the above areas, the United States welcomed Japan's efforts to bolster its defense industrial security base with the publication of the first Defense Industrial Security Manual, as well as Japan's participation in the Multinational Industrial Security Working Group (MISWG) as the first Asian country to become an official member, and Japan's passage of the Act on the Protection and Utilization of Important Economic Security Information. Alliance Force Posture The Ministers emphasized the importance of optimizing Alliance force posture to address increasing security challenges in the region and be better postured to meet these challenges in the future. To this end, they welcomed the U.S. plan to modernize its tactical aircraft laydown across Japan. The modernization plan reflects capability investments to enhance the U.S.-Japan Alliance and bolster regional deterrence. The Ministers celebrated the U.S. redesignation of the 12th Marine Regiment to the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR), and the steady implementation of the MLR reorganization toward initial operational capability by 2025. They welcomed the forward deployment and return of the USS George Washington to Japan, and its critical role in supporting Alliance deterrence. To maintain deterrence and mitigate impact on local communities, the Ministers reiterated their firm commitment to the steady implementation of the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in accordance with the Okinawa Consolidation Plan and other existing bilateral arrangements, including construction of relocation facilities and land returns in Okinawa. Following the progress of construction in the Oura-wan area, the Ministers underlined the importance of accelerating bilateral work toward the total return of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Futenma as early as practicable including the construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility at Henoko as the only solution that avoids the continued use of MCAS Futenma. The Ministers confirmed the relocation of Marine Corps personnel from Okinawa to Guam beginning in 2024. The Ministers highlighted progress on development of the SDF facility on Mageshima. They underscored the importance of continued bilateral coordination for sharing timely information on incidents and accidents. In the spirit of alliance cooperation, the Ministers welcomed the efforts to be implemented by USFJ to prevent unacceptable incidents and behavior.

This includes both countries' commitment to implement FIP lines of effort during the duration of the 2022 Special Measures Agreement and to take all appropriate initiatives with the aim of further ensuring timely and effective implementation of the 164.1 billion yen budget, which was reaffirmed in the Joint Statement of the SCC in 2022. Coordination on Environmental Issues and Humanitarian Assistance In line with President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida's Joint Leaders Statement in April to respond more rapidly to climate change-related and other natural disasters by establishing a HA/DR hub in Japan, the Ministers decided to convene a task force for the operational requirements to move in an expedited manner. The Ministers discussed enhancing bilateral environmental cooperation, including on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) issues, in compliance with the Status of Forces Agreement and related arrangements. Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) The Ministers underscored that cooperation on WPS will uphold our global partnership goals of advancing the empowerment of women and girls, achieving gender equality, and including diverse perspectives in national security activities. The Ministers affirmed that realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific requires the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women in leadership positions as well as their contributions toward conflict prevention, reconstruction, and peacebuilding. The Ministers welcomed efforts, including ongoing U.S. Forces commitment to recurring WPS symposiums, Japanese participation at the USINDOPACOM Regional Military Gender Advisor Course, bilateral cooperation under ASEAN working groups, Japan's continued engagement and leadership with the WPS Focal Points Network, integration of WPS into disaster risk reduction policies and efforts, and bilateral support for the regional WPS Center of Excellence. The Ministers confirmed they will further explore cooperation by continuing to promote participation in U.S. and Japanese-led WPS activities, as well as through incorporating WPS considerations in regular bilateral training, exercises, and other activities. Investment in People for the Alliance The strong bonds of friendship between our peoples anchor and sustain our growing global partnership. Further strengthening these bonds, including through cultural and educational exchanges, are the most effective way to develop future stewards of the U.S.-Japan relationship. The Ministers emphasized the importance of building new and expanding existing exchange opportunities, such as Think of Okinawa's Future in the U.S. (TOFU) and Student Educational Exchange and Dialogue (SEED), to create a diverse pipeline of future U.S.-Japan experts who support the Alliance. Our peoples form the core of our Alliance, and we reaffirm our commitment to forge ever-closer bonds for generations to come.

 "text": "President Biden is an extraordinary guardian of America's national security. I am deeply grateful for his leadership and statesmanship. He has a secure place in American history as one of our great foreign-policy presidents. President Biden renewed, deepened, and broadened the unmatched global network of alliances and partnerships that makes America more secure; he rallied the world to defend Ukraine after the Kremlin's indefensible, all-out invasion in 2022; he positioned America to succeed in our strategic competition with the People's Republic of China; he dramatically strengthened U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific; he bolstered, united, and expanded NATO; he shored up Israel's security after Hamas's vile October 7th terrorist assault and worked tirelessly to protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza; he ended America's longest war; he helped the United States and the world recover from the COVID pandemic that killed more than a million Americans; he launched the historic trilateral AUKUS partnership to make the Indo-Pacific region more secure; and at a time when autocrats brag of being the wave of the future, he showed the world the resilience and the resolve that only a democracy can muster. President Biden has been a stalwart defender of free government, a fearless foe of tyranny, and a historic champion of an open world of rules, rights, and responsibilities. As Commander in Chief, President Biden has shown his profound and personal commitment to the Department of Defense and the American military. Under his leadership, the most recent National Defense Authorization Act supports an historic $841 billion in funding for the Department of Defense and helps ensure that the U.S. military will remain the strongest fighting force on Earth. President Biden has always understood that America's greatest strategic advantage is our people, and he has sought to make America even stronger and more secure by drawing on the full talents of all of our citizenry. He has made history by breaking barrier after barrier, including appointing Kathleen Hicks as the first female Deputy Secretary of Defense, Christine Wormuth as the first female Secretary of the Army, Admiral Lisa Franchetti as the first female Chief of Naval Operations and the first woman on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and myself as the first Black Secretary of Defense. President Biden cares deeply about our outstanding all-volunteer force and has insisted on making life easier for them and their families, including securing significant pay raises for our troops. President Biden always ends his speeches by saying, \"God bless our troops\" and we know that he means every word, every time. President Biden has repeatedly declared, \"We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example.\" Today, he has done just that. The entire Department of Defense stands united today in saluting President Biden's service to the country that we defend, the Constitution that we revere, and the republic that we love.

 "text": "Today, the Department of Defense has moved to rectify an old injustice and face up to a painful episode in our own history. I applaud the Secretary of the Navy s decision to exonerate 258 Black Sailors who were unjustly court-martialed in the wake of the devastating explosion at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine in California, which killed 320 Sailors on July 17, 1944. After the blast, these 258 Sailors refused to keep loading munitions in the same unsafe and inhumane conditions that contributed to the catastrophe. Eighty years later, we recognize that those 258 Sailors were right, and the segregated Navy that unnecessarily risked their lives was wrong. The NAACP, Thurgood Marshall, Eleanor Roosevelt, and others recognized the case as a travesty at the time. The Department of Defense must continue to learn from our past, and today s decision reflects our commitment to reckoning with our history even when it is painful. I am deeply grateful for all the people of conscience in the U.S. Navy who have worked diligently to make this day possible, and to the advocates and family members who have pushed hard for so many decades to remedy this injustice. We honor the memory of the 320 dedicated Americans who lost their lives in the Port Chicago explosion, and we honor the service of the 258 brave Americans who refused afterward to bend to racist and cruel treatment. The Department of Defense must always ensure that our Service members, our military families, and our civilian employees are treated with fairness and dignity, especially within our military justice systems.

 "title": "United States-Japan-Republic of Korea Trilateral Ministerial Meeting (TMM) Joint Press Statement",
 "text": "U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Japan Minister of Defense Kihara Minoru, and Republic of Korea (ROK) Minister of National Defense Shin Won-sik convened a Trilateral Ministerial Meeting on June 2, 2024, in Singapore. They discussed shared regional security concerns, reviewed the implementation of trilateral security cooperation lines of effort presented at the historic Camp David Summit on August 18, 2023, and discussed new initiatives to strengthen and institutionalize trilateral security cooperation to contribute to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, in the Indo-Pacific region, and beyond. The leaders underscored the importance of maintaining this momentum and decided to hold the Trilateral Ministerial Meeting (TMM), the Trilateral Chiefs of Defense (Tri-CHOD) meeting, and the Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT) with the intent to rotate hosting beginning this year. The Secretary and the two Ministers affirmed their enduring commitment to strengthen trilateral security cooperation to deter nuclear and missile threats posed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and to achieve the complete denuclearization of the DPRK in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). They condemned the DPRK's recent diversification of nuclear delivery systems, tests and launches of multiple ballistic missiles, the launches of what the DPRK purports to be a military reconnaissance satellite using ballistic missile technology, illicit ship-to-ship transfers, and arms shipments with Russia as clear violations of multiple UNSCRs. The United States reaffirmed its ironclad commitment to the defense of Japan and the ROK, emphasizing its commitment is backed by the full range of U.S. capabilities, including conventional and nuclear. The three leaders urged the international community to advance its stated goal of ensuring the DPRK fully complies with its obligations under relevant UNSCRs, and affirmed they will redouble their efforts in support of effective UNSCR implementation following Russia's veto blocking the renewal of the UN Panel of Experts' mandate to monitor implementation of sanctions on the DPRK. The three sides also expressed concern about the DPRK's most recent attempt to launch a military satellite and urged the DPRK to cease all further destabilizing activities immediately. They reaffirmed that a DPRK nuclear test, if conducted, would be met with a strong and resolute response from the international community. They also reiterated that the path to dialogue remains open toward peaceful and diplomatic resolution with the DPRK. The Secretary and the Ministers stressed the importance of the rules-based international order and reaffirmed their commitment to stand with Ukraine against Russia's unprovoked and brutal war of aggression, and recognized that Russia's actions are a serious violation of the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty that undermine the fabric of the international order. The three leaders exchanged views on implementing the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy, Japan's new plan for a \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific,\" and the ROK Strategy for a Free, Peaceful, and Prosperous Indo-Pacific Region. As emphasized at the Camp David Summit, the Secretary and the Ministers reaffirmed that they strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the waters of the Indo-Pacific, and they recalled their respective positions regarding the dangerous and aggressive behavior by the People's Republic of China (PRC) supporting unlawful maritime claims that they have recently witnessed in the South China Sea. They shared concerns about actions that are inconsistent with international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). They stressed the importance of fully respecting international law including the freedom of navigation and overflight. Additionally, they recognized that there is no change in their basic positions on Taiwan and emphasized the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community. They called for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. The Secretary and the Ministers recognized progress made since the August 2023 Camp David Summit, including the activation of a data sharing mechanism to exchange real-time missile warning data to detect and assess ballistic missiles launched by the DPRK. They pledged to enhance cooperation by further optimizing the data-sharing mechanism by the end of this year to ensure the ability to deter and counter provocations effectively. The Secretary and the Ministers decided to execute the first iteration of the new, multi-domain trilateral exercise, FREEDOM EDGE, this summer. They reaffirmed that trilateral exercises will be executed in a systematic manner in accordance with the multi-year trilateral exercise plan, which was established last year following the August 2023 Camp David Summit. The leaders also decided to conduct a trilateral tabletop exercise (TTX) to discuss how to effectively deter and respond, based on various threats on the Korean Peninsula and in the Indo-Pacific region. The Secretary and the Ministers recognized the importance of continuing to advance trilateral cooperation following the August 2023 Camp David Summit and pledged to develop a trilateral security cooperation framework within the year to institutionalize trilateral security cooperation, including senior-level policy consultations, information sharing, trilateral exercises, and defense exchange cooperation. Japan and the ROK highlighted the importance of their bilateral ties and trilateral cooperation to protect and advance their shared security goals. The Secretary and the two Ministers committed to continue to strengthen trilateral cooperation to ensure peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, the Indo-Pacific, and beyond.

We will continue to insist on cohesion, trust, dignity, and security for every member of the force. Over the past three years, the Department has taken unprecedented steps to tackle this problem. This includes swift and rigorous implementation of the approved recommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military, as well as the establishment of the Offices of Special Trial Counsel. Today the Department of Defense released our Fiscal Year 2023 Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military. Its findings demonstrate that the Department is making progress to prevent sexual assault and harassment in the military. This is the first time that the Department has seen a decrease in the prevalence of sexual assault in more than eight years. These early findings are encouraging, and I am grateful for the leadership of many across the Department who have committed the time and made the investments to produce these promising results. However, we have far more work to do. Last week, I convened the Deputy Secretary, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Service Secretaries, and the Service Chiefs to discuss this report s findings. I made clear that we re making significant progress but we must double down on our efforts to end sexual assault and sexual harassment. This remains a key readiness issue across the joint force. The only acceptable number of instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment in the U.S. military is zero. We owe it to all our Service members to get this right.

 "title": "Joint Statement From Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani",
 "text": "Today at the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III welcomed Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia al-Sudani during his first visit to Washington, D.C. as Prime Minister. The Secretary and the Prime Minister affirmed the two nations' commitment to an enduring U.S.-Iraq bilateral defense relationship and to a strong Iraq, capable of self-defense in support of a more stable and peaceful region. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq and the Secretary of Defense discussed ongoing U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation, joint efforts to address persistent security threats to the United States and Iraq, and the future of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS mission in Iraq. The visit occurred one week after the Principals Meeting on April 8 of the U.S.-Iraq Higher Military Commission (HMC), a professional military-to-military dialogue between Iraqi and U.S. military leaders and professionals to determine how and when to end the international coalition and how the D-ISIS Coalition will evolve based on the level of threat from ISIS, the Iraqi Security Forces' (ISF) capabilities, and other operational and environmental factors. Secretary Austin thanked Prime Minister Sudani for Iraq's role in supporting operations by the Global Coalition to ensure ISIS can never reconstitute in Iraq and Syria. The Secretary paid tribute to the immense sacrifices of the Iraqi people and security forces in the fight to liberate millions from ISIS's genocidal and barbaric rule. ISIS threatens international security, and Iraq, as a well-positioned and equipped partner, represents a linchpin in the campaign to defeat ISIS by hosting Coalition forces. The Secretary also noted Iraq's leadership in repatriating more than 4,100 Iraqi nationals from displacement camps and detention facilities in northeastern Syria last year. Prime Minister Sudani affirmed the importance of accelerating such repatriations of Iraqi nationals and facilitating their safe reintegration or, if needed, to hold them accountable for crimes they may have committed through appropriate judicial processes. Addressing the strategic nature of the U.S.-Iraq bilateral defense relationship and Iraq's role as leader in ensuring regional security, the Secretary and Prime Minister discussed efforts to modernize the ISF, including Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and build their capabilities. Iraq's partnership with the United States features Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and a broad range of train and equip activities supporting the security forces funded with the Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund (CTEF). DoD also implements Foreign Military Financing (FMF)-funded defense articles and services and International Military Education and Training (IMET)-professional military education courses on behalf of the Department of State. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq and the Secretary of Defense hailed the signing of a joint work protocol recognizing the intended FMS purchase by Iraq worth nearly $550M using the new Credit Assured Payment Schedule (CAPS) flexible payment mechanism. Iraq will be the first nation to use the CAPS financing opportunity, for which terms of sale allow Iraq to make payments towards the FMS case over time rather than all up front a sign of the strength of our partnership now and into the future. The Secretary and Prime Minister also highlighted ongoing efforts between the Department of Defense and Ministry of Defense to secure key sites across Iraq, including the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, from aerial threats. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq and the Secretary of Defense look forward to Iraq and the United States convening strategic discussions on the future of the U.S.-Iraq security relationship pursuant to the 2008 U.S.-Iraqi Strategic Framework Agreement at the second Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue later this year. Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to an orderly transition to enduring bilateral security partnerships between Iraq and the United States and other countries of the Coalition in accordance with the Iraqi constitution and the strategic framework agreement.

 "text": "Seventy-five years ago today, on April 4, 1949, the United States and many of our closest allies signed the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, DC. In the aftermath of World War II, in the face of the new threat of Soviet aggression, the original 12 NATO Allies resolved to promote security in the North Atlantic area, to safeguard freedom and democracy, and to stand together for their collective defense. From that foundation, we have built the strongest, most successful Alliance in human history. In the 21st century, NATO remains the bulwark of our common security and America's commitment to this great defensive alliance remains a sacred trust. Today's 32-member alliance is larger than ever, after the historic recent addition of the proud democracies of Finland and Sweden; stronger than ever; and more united than ever. Putin's reckless and lawless invasion of Ukraine has brought war back to Europe on a scale that NATO's founders had hoped to consign to history. Today, the world needs NATO as much as ever. When our leaders meet in Washington in July for NATO's 75th-anniversary Summit, we will strengthen our resilience, accelerate the development of advanced technologies, advance the implementation of NATO's most robust defense plans since the Cold War, and strengthen our collective deterrence and defense. Today and every day, the United States and our NATO Allies reaffirm their bedrock commitment to view an attack on one ally as an attack on all allies. Our commitment to Article Five remains ironclad. America's network of Allies and partners built and sustained by successive generations of wise and bipartisan postwar American leadership remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match and that no foe should doubt. Today, we salute NATO's achievements, and we pledge to build upon them. Austin Defense Secretary NATO partnerships"

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III Marking Two Years Since Russia's Invasion of Ukraine",
 "text": "Two years ago, Russian forces launched an illegal and indefensible all-out invasion of Ukraine. But Ukraine's defiance in the face of Putin's aggression and atrocities has inspired free people everywhere. Over the past two years, Putin has assumed that Ukraine's forces would collapse and that Ukraine's friends would cower. He couldn't have been more wrong. The scale of Putin's blunder is especially stark today. The Kremlin's forces failed to win the Battle of Kyiv, failed to topple Ukraine's democratically elected government, and failed to crush the will of the Ukrainian people. Ukraine has retaken more than half of the sovereign territory that was grabbed by the Kremlin's forces in 2022. And as a result of Putin's unprovoked war, Russia has suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties, lost significant equipment, and severely set back its military modernization program. However, Ukraine faces a tough fight ahead. I urge members of Congress to act quickly to pass the national-security supplemental to ensure that Ukrainian troops have what they need to defend their country and their citizens from Russia's cruelty and to send a strong message of America's continued commitment to Ukraine's freedom. We will also continue to rally the world to support Ukraine. Since 2022, I have regularly convened some 50 countries from around the world as part of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. This global coalition works together to ensure that Ukraine has the capabilities that it needs to defend its people from Russian aggression and take back its sovereign territory. I hosted the most recent meeting of this Contact Group just last week, and I was struck again by the steadiness of its members' collective resolve. This historic coalition has committed more than $87 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of Putin's war including 15 U.S. allies that, as a percentage of GDP, contribute more to Ukraine's capability needs than the United States. We must continue to be candid with the American people about the stakes in Ukraine. The Kremlin's war poses a direct threat to security in Europe and beyond. The world will only become more dangerous if Putin and his fellow autocrats conclude that they can wipe democracies off the map and force free people to live in fear. So today's grim milestone should spur us all to decide what kind of future we want for our children and grandchildren: an open, secure, and prosperous world of rules and rights, or the violent and lawless world of aggression and chaos that Putin seeks. We support Ukraine's fight for freedom, both because it is the right thing to do and because doing so is central to America's continued security. After two years of Putin's reckless and lawless war, we salute Ukraine's brave defenders, and we wish Ukraine's unbowed citizens peace, security, and freedom.

 "text": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III provided the following statement on today's NATO Defense Ministerial in Brussels: I am pleased by the progress that the United States and its allies made at today's meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. Almost two years after Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever. NATO is the strongest military alliance in history, and it is crucial for America's continued security. As President Biden has noted, \"NATO is built on the fundamental principles of freedom, security, and national sovereignty.\" A secure America is impossible without a strong NATO. The blunt military reality is that America's allies are a profoundly powerful force multiplier. Those who wish America harm have long sought to rupture NATO. This mighty alliance's continued unity is vital to meet the strategic dangers posed by Putin's unprovoked aggression and imperial dreams. NATO became even more capable last year when Finland joined our proud alliance. I again urge Hungary to support immediate NATO accession for Sweden, which is both a stalwart democracy and a hugely capable defense partner. The United States looks forward to welcoming Sweden as an ally to NATO's 75th-anniversary Washington Summit in July. At the Vilnius Summit last year, our leaders made historic decisions that will strengthen NATO's deterrence and defense. Today, my fellow ministers of defense continued our work to fulfill our leaders' commitments and to provide the full resources necessary for our new regional plans. These plans will improve our ability to deter and defend against any threat, well into the future. But to do so, we need all of our allies to provide resources for the plans and allocate the necessary troops and capabilities. Allies also must continue to invest in their defense industrial bases, which is crucial to the future strength of the alliance. I welcome what Secretary General Stoltenberg yesterday called an \"unprecedented rise\" in defense spending across our European and Canadian allies, who have added more than $600 billion for defense since the Defense Investment Pledge was made in 2014, including a real increase of 11 percent in defense spending in 2023 alone. The Secretary General projects that in 2024, 18 allies will spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense a major improvement over 2014, when only three hit that target. Any ally not spending at least two percent of GDP on defense this year should have plans to swiftly meet that target. The allies also reaffirmed our enduring commitment to a free and sovereign Ukraine, including a productive meeting among our allies, the European Union, and Ukraine in the recently established NATO-Ukraine Council. We stand behind NATO's continued support of Ukraine through the Comprehensive Assistance Package NATO's multi-year program for critical, non-lethal aid. That effort complements the more than $87 billion in bilateral security assistance that the United States and countries around the world have committed over the past two years to help Ukraine defend itself from Putin's unprovoked aggression. We are coming up on the two-year mark since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The United States and our allies and partners will stand by Ukraine for the long haul. The United States will continue to stand with our NATO allies and to defend the sovereignty and the territory of every alliance member every inch of it, as President Biden has repeatedly made clear. Our commitment to Article Five remains ironclad. Our allies magnify our strength and expand our security. America's network of allies and partners worldwide built and sustained by wise administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of World War II remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match and that none should doubt. U.S. leadership on the world stage will not diminish, and we will continue to strengthen our bonds with our deeply valued allies as we look toward NATO's historic 75th-anniversary summit in Washington. NATO remains the greatest alliance in history and as President Biden said at the Vilnius Summit, NATO today is stronger, more united, and \"more vital to our shared future\" than ever.

 "title": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III Statement on the 19th Ukraine Defense Contact Group",
 "text": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III provided the following statement today on the 19th Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting: The Ukraine Defense Contact Group has just wrapped up its 19th meeting and another highly successful one. We convened virtually, and I look forward to soon convening another session of this Contact Group in person. Ever since our first meeting in Ramstein, it has been inspiring to see some 50 of our trusted allies and partners worldwide rally together to support the embattled democracy of Ukraine. This broad, steady, and determined coalition is a stark contrast to Putin's increasingly self-isolated Russia left alone with the likes of Iran and North Korea. America's unparalleled network of allies and partners remains a strategic asset that no rival can match. America's allies extend our strength, magnify our power, and deepen our security. Later this month, we'll mark two years since the Kremlin launched its reckless war of imperial aggression against Ukraine. When Putin ordered his unprovoked and indefensible invasion, he assumed that Ukraine's forces would collapse and that Ukraine's friends would cower. But Ukraine's troops have fought like lions, and countries of conscience from around the world have raced to get Ukraine's back. That has made a historic difference on the battlefield, enabling Ukraine's brave defenders to retake more than half of the land grabbed by the Kremlin since its all-out invasion on February 24, 2022. Ukraine's struggle matters profoundly for global security. We support Ukraine's self-defense because it is the right thing to do and because it is crucial to American and global security. Putin's inexcusable war of choice poses a direct threat to security and stability in Europe and beyond. If we falter, if we give Putin reason to doubt our collective determination, if we meet Putin's naked aggression with retreat instead of resolve we will only embolden him and other would-be aggressors worldwide. That will invite more turmoil and tyranny, in Europe and far beyond. So we will not allow Putin to prevail. Neither will the allies and partners who stood together again today, shoulder to shoulder, united by both pragmatism and principle. This historic, U.S.-led coalition of some 50 countries from around the globe has committed more than $85 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Putin began his appalling all-out invasion in February 2022. In fact, as a percentage of GDP, more than a dozen of our allies contribute more to Ukraine's self-defense than the United States. Today, the entire Contact Group focused on Ukraine's urgent needs on the battlefield and to helping prepare the Ukrainian future force that can deter and defeat Russian aggression over the long haul. Together, we are deepening our commitment to Ukraine by leading what we call \"capability coalitions.\" And they have hit the ground running. In just a few months, thanks to exemplary leadership and participation from our fellow Contact Group members, we have set up eight capability coalitions. That will help us continue to meet and anticipate Ukraine's battlefield needs, and lay the foundation for Ukraine's long-term security. The United States is proud to co-lead two of these capability coalitions. Together with Denmark and the Netherlands, we are leading the coalition helping Ukraine meet its urgent needs for air-force capabilities. We are also working with our French allies to co-lead the capability coalition on artillery. The United States is deeply grateful to the other friends that have stepped up to lead the other capability coalitions: Denmark and the Netherlands; Germany and France; the United Kingdom and Norway; Poland and Estonia; and Luxembourg, Latvia, and Lithuania. The capability coalitions are the sturdy, flexible structure to ensure that we can meet Ukraine's requirements over the long haul. The outcome of Ukraine's struggle will help determine the trajectory of security in the 21st century. We understand the stakes and we understand the dangers of retreat. Almost two years into Putin's bloody and dishonorable invasion, the United States and our trusted allies and partners continue to stand firmly with the Ukrainian people and with the brave Ukrainian troops fighting for their country's freedom. And we continue to stand strong for the shared security that comes from an open world of rules, rights, and responsibilities. Austin Defense Secretary ukraine response"

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the Senate's Passage of the National-Security Supplemental",
 "text": "I applaud the Senate's passage of the vital national-security supplemental, which will advance our core security interests and our bedrock values as we continue to stand firm with our Allies and partners around the world. This critical piece of bipartisan legislation will provide urgently needed military aid to help Ukraine defend itself against Putin's flagrant aggression; it will deliver additional security assistance to Israel after the October 7th Hamas terrorist assault, along with humanitarian aid for innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza; and it will bolster our deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. The national-security bill will also provide additional resources for U.S. Central Command to support our forces facing attacks from Iranian-backed militias and protecting international commerce in the Red Sea from the Houthis' reckless and unlawful attacks. This bill also strengthens our domestic industries and provides resources to create more good American jobs across the country, including $20 billion to buy new capabilities and gear to restock U.S. military inventories, $13.8 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and $3.3 billion to strengthen the U.S. submarine industrial base. As was the case for previous supplementals, the bulk of the supplemental would flow through our defense industrial base, supporting American jobs in dozens of states across our country and creating greater prosperity at home and greater security around the world. The need for this supplemental may be most urgently felt in Ukraine. Top Ukrainian defense officials have already warned us that their units no longer have the stores of ammunition that they need to hold off Putin's invading forces. I also call upon Congress to pass a full-year appropriation. Failure to fund the Defense Department in line with the annual defense bill would have serious consequences for America's security, economy, global standing, and democracy. Only one country can provide the leadership that this moment demands and that's the United States of America. The dangers of our time will only grow worse without strong and steady American leadership. If we do not deter other would-be aggressors, we will only invite more aggression, bloodshed, and chaos. So the cost of American leadership remains far lower than the cost of American abdication and retreat. The world is watching, and lives are on the line. I urge the House to pass this bipartisan bill immediately to invest in America's national security. Defense Secretary Austin ukraine response israel support Prosperity Guardian Indo-Pacific"

 "text": "The United States and the Government of Iraq will start working group meetings of the U.S.-Iraq Higher Military Commission (HMC) in the coming days, initiating a process the two sides committed to during the U.S.-Iraq Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue (JSCD) in Washington, D.C., on August 7-8, 2023. The commencement of the HMC process reflects the deep U.S. commitment to regional stability and Iraqi sovereignty. The HMC will enable the transition to an enduring bilateral security partnership between the United States and Iraq, building on the successes of Iraq's Defeat-Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (D-ISIS) campaign in partnership with the Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve as part of the Global Coalition to D-ISIS. The HMC builds upon the inaugural U.S.-Iraq JSCD, held on August 7-8, 2023. During that meeting, the United States and Iraq committed to start the HMC to discuss how the Coalition's mission to defeat ISIS will transition on a timeline that considers three key factors: the threat from ISIS, operational and environmental requirements, and the Iraqi security forces' capability levels. Expert working groups of military and defense professionals will examine these three factors and advise the HMC on the most effective evolution of the D-ISIS Coalition mission, ensuring that ISIS can never resurge, in consultation with Coalition partners at all stages of the process. U.S. military personnel are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve's mission to advise, assist, and enable the Iraqi security forces in their ongoing fight against ISIS. The United States remains committed to a secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq. The United States and Iraq have enjoyed a deep and productive partnership on security matters in the 10 years since the Iraqi government invited the United States and the Coalition to fight ISIS, including the seven years since the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq. The start of the HMC process reflects the evolving U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship under the Strategic Framework Agreement, and it underscores our commitment to deepen our security cooperation to advance stability within Iraq and the region.

Austin III's medical care: As part of Secretary Austin's routinely recommended health screening, he has undergone regular prostate specific antigen (PSA) surveillance. Changes in his laboratory evaluation in early December 2023 identified prostate cancer which required treatment. On December 22, 2023, after consultation with his medical team, he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and underwent a minimally invasive surgical procedure called a prostatectomy to treat and cure prostate cancer. He was under general anesthesia during this procedure. Secretary Austin recovered uneventfully from his surgery and returned home the next morning. His prostate cancer was detected early, and his prognosis is excellent. On January 1st, 2024, Secretary Austin was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with complications from the December 22 procedure, including nausea with severe abdominal, hip, and leg pain. Initial evaluation revealed a urinary tract infection. On January 2, the decision was made to transfer him to the ICU for close monitoring and a higher level of care. Further evaluation revealed abdominal fluid collections impairing the function of his small intestines. This resulted in the back up of his intestinal contents which was treated by placing a tube through his nose to drain his stomach. The abdominal fluid collections were drained by non-surgical drain placement. He has progressed steadily throughout his stay. His infection has cleared. He continues to make progress and we anticipate a full recovery although this can be a slow process. During this stay, Secretary Austin never lost consciousness and never underwent general anesthesia. Prostate cancer is the most common cause of cancer among American men, and it impacts 1 in every 8 men and 1 in every 6 African American men - during their lifetime. Despite the frequency of prostate cancer, discussions about screening, treatment, and support are often deeply personal and private ones. Early screening is important for detection and treatment of prostate cancer and people should talk to their doctors to see what screening is appropriate for them. Austin Defense Secretary"

He was the first Black commander of a U.S. Army corps, and he later served as the first Black director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration. He was also a mentor and a dear friend. Lieutenant General Becton was deeply committed to the institutions that he loved and led, especially the U.S. Army. He decided at a young age that the U.S. Army was his ticket out of poverty even in a time when our armed forces were still segregated and he rose through the Army's ranks and fought for his country in three wars. After retiring from the U.S. Army, he spearheaded an overhaul of FEMA. That was just a part of his lifelong mission to make our institutions more purposeful, more reliable, and more responsive to the people whom they served. As the son of a domestic worker and a janitor with a third-grade education, Lieutenant General Becton believed passionately in the power of learning. That commitment drove his leadership both as superintendent of the District of Columbia Public Schools and as president of Prairie View A&M University his alma mater which he helped lead out of a period of decline. I count myself among a generation of U.S. Army officers and enlisted men and women who owe our careers to Lieutenant General Becton's guidance and example. \"Leadership and ethics are inseparable,\" he said, and I have carried his lessons with me throughout my career.

 "title": "AUKUS Defense Ministers Meeting Joint Statement",
 "text": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III hosted the Honourable Richard Marles MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, Australia, and the Right Honourable Grant Shapps, Secretary of State for Defence, United Kingdom, at the Defense Innovation Unit Headquarters in California today to discuss the AUKUS enhanced defense and security partnership. For more than a century, the three nations have stood shoulder-to-shoulder, along with other allies and partners, to help sustain peace, stability and prosperity around the world. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged that, in the face of an evolving security environment, AUKUS presents a generational opportunity to modernize and enhance longstanding partnerships and cooperation to address global security challenges and contribute to stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister reaffirmed that at the core of this partnership is the shared resolve to bolster security and stability and ensure that the Indo-Pacific remains a region free from coercion and aggression. For Australia's acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines (Pillar I), AUKUS partners are collaborating to deliver this capability at the earliest possible date while upholding the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard. For Advanced Capabilities (Pillar II), AUKUS partners are substantially deepening cooperation on a range of security and defense capabilities, making sure that each nation has the capabilities needed to defend against rapidly evolving threats. Through these efforts, AUKUS contributes to integrated deterrence by pursuing layered and asymmetric capabilities that promote increased security and stability. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister reaffirmed the three nations' commitment to maximize the strategic and technological advantage of AUKUS by combining national strengths and pooling resources to deliver game-changing capabilities. They agreed that advancing AUKUS requires continued commitment to streamlining defense trade controls and information-sharing while minimizing policy and financial barriers across public and private sectors. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister directed their organizations to continue taking additional steps to promote efficient defense and industrial collaboration among the three nations. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister reaffirmed that all AUKUS collaboration is and will be undertaken in full compliance with the partners' respective international legal obligations and commitments. In pursuit of this shared vision, the Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister endorsed the following announcements and initiatives across both Pillar I and Pillar II. PILLAR I CONVENTIONALLY ARMED, NUCLEAR-POWERED SUBMARINES The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister reviewed the exceptional progress that has been made since the March 2023 announcement of the Optimal Pathway for Australia to acquire conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. They discussed the strategic significance of this endeavor and the deterrence effect it is already delivering. They reaffirmed their commitment to delivering each phase, to include establishing Submarine Rotational Force-West (SRF-West) in Australia as early as 2027, selling U.S. Virginia-class submarines to Australia from the early 2030s, and delivering SSN-AUKUS to the Royal Navy in the late 2030s and the first Australian-built SSN-AUKUS to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in the early 2040s. Increased Royal Australian Navy Education and Training. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged the significant progress on increased education and training opportunities for RAN personnel to attend specialized U.S. and UK schools, including training at the U.S. Submarine School in Groton, U.S. Nuclear Power School in Charleston, and the UK Nuclear Power School at HMS Sultan. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister were pleased that six RAN officers have now graduated the U.S. Nuclear Power School, with a further three RAN officers on track to graduate from the UK Nuclear Power School in January 2024. This follows two RAN officers who have completed other Sultan nuclear operator courses, with two more planned. These pioneering cohorts will be the first to operate Australia's future nuclear-powered submarines. Increased Industry Training. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister were pleased that the first tranche of Australian industry personnel have commenced work at Pearl Harbor Navy Shipyard in the United States and Barrow-in-Furness shipyard in the UK to develop their skills to build and sustain nuclear-powered submarines. This will support future maintenance activities during nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) visits to Australia. Preparing for Submarine Rotational Force-West. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister noted that efforts are well underway to increase Australia's experience with nuclear-powered submarines and build Australia's capacity to participate in future maintenance activities. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister announced that Australian sailors will commence duty in Guam in early 2024 to build their SSN maintenance skills and qualifications in the lead up to SRF-West. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister also agreed to the increased frequency of SSN visits to HMAS Stirling in 2024, building on the USS NORTH CAROLINA visit in August 2023. The next U.S. SSN visit is planned to occur in the first half of 2024. The first planned maintenance activity of a U.S. SSN is planned to occur at HMAS Stirring in the second half of 2024. This will represent a substantial increase in Australian Defence Force participation in maintenance activities on U.S. SSNs. The UK reiterated its commitment to increasing SSN port visits beginning in 2026. Upholding the Highest Non-Proliferation Standard. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister reaffirmed their shared commitment to upholding the highest standard for nuclear non-proliferation, and welcomed the regular, open, and transparent engagement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to date. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged commencement of Australia's bilateral negotiations with the IAEA on an arrangement pursuant to Article 14 of Australia's Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. Enabling Legislation. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister discussed the importance of securing legislative support across all three systems to ensure the success of AUKUS. Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister welcomed the new Foreign Military Sales case between Australia and the United States presented to the U.S. Congress, which will facilitate early delivery of capability to support SRF-West and provide mechanisms to train Australians. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister also welcomed Australia's introduction of legislation to the Australian Parliament which will establish the framework to ensure nuclear safety within Australia's nuclear-powered submarine enterprise, including establishing an independent nuclear safety regulator. They also welcomed the entry into force of the first AUKUS enabling legislation introduced to the Australian Parliament, the Defence Legislation Amendment (Naval Nuclear Propulsion) Act 2023, in July 2023. PILLAR II ADVANCED CAPABILITIES Pillar II is accelerating and deepening the development and delivery of advanced military capabilities. The strategic alignment of our national defense strategies, anchored by our shared values, is facilitating unprecedented collaboration in advanced technologies. In addition to work focused on dedicated AUKUS capabilities, AUKUS is providing a vehicle to break down barriers and improve cooperation in other areas. While many AUKUS-related advanced capability activities remain classified, the Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister shared the following commitments: AUKUS Maritime Autonomy Experimentation and Exercise Series. The AUKUS partners will undertake a series of integrated trilateral experiments and exercises aimed at enhancing capability development, improving interoperability, and increasing the sophistication and scale of autonomous systems in the maritime domain. The experiments and exercises will provide opportunities for defense industry to participate in capability demonstration, development, and delivery. Through these experiments and exercises, the AUKUS partners will also further test and refine the ability to jointly operate uncrewed maritime systems, share and process maritime data from all three nations, and provide real-time maritime domain awareness to support decision-making. Trilateral Anti-Submarine Warfare. The AUKUS partners have demonstrated and will deploy common advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms on multiple systems, including P-8A Maritime Patrol Aircraft, to process data from each nation's sonobuoys. These joint advances will allow for timely high-volume data analysis, improving our anti-submarine warfare capabilities. Undersea Vehicle Launch and Recovery. The AUKUS partners are integrating the ability to launch and recover undersea vehicles from torpedo tubes on current classes of submarines to deliver effects such as strike and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. This capability increases the range and capability of our undersea forces and will also support SSN-AUKUS. Quantum Positioning, Navigation, and Timing. The AUKUS partners are accelerating the development of quantum technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing in military capabilities. These capabilities create resilience for our trilateral forces in Global Positioning System-degraded environments and enhance stealth in the undersea domain, which will also support SSN-AUKUS. Resilient and Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Technologies (RAAIT). The AUKUS partners are delivering artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning to enhance force protection, precision targeting, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. This effort builds on joint work demonstrated in the UK in April 2023 and in South Australia in October 2023. The AUKUS nations aim to integrate RAAIT into national programs in 2024, to pursue the rapid adoption of these technologies across land and maritime domains. Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability. AUKUS is accelerating capabilities that provide trilateral partners with advanced technology to identify emerging threats in space. AUKUS played a critical role in advancing trilateral collaboration on the Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability program, which will provide 24-hour continuous, all-weather global coverage to detect, track, and identify objects in deep space and increase space domain awareness. This capability will contribute to the security, safety, and responsible use of space. Sites will be in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. The first radar site in Western Australia will be operational in 2026, with all three in service by the end of the decade. Cyber. Trilaterally, AUKUS partners are engaging on cyber security with critical suppliers to the naval supply chain. We are collaborating with industry partners to deploy some advanced tooling which will uplift the cyber security of our supply chains, while also giving us greater insight into the threats to AUKUS. The AUKUS partners are also working to strengthen cyber capabilities, including protecting critical communication and operations' systems. Establishing Trilateral Requirements. The AUKUS partners are committed to ensuring AUKUS capability and technology development focuses on the most important military challenges each nation faces. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister noted that the International Joint Requirements Oversight Council, co-chaired by the Vice Chiefs of Defense from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, is a key collaborative forum for identifying and validating operational requirements common to our three nations that will contribute to deterrence and our ability to prevail if deterrence fails. AUKUS Innovation Challenges. The AUKUS partners are aligning our defense innovation ecosystems by creating seamless opportunities for trilateral cooperation. AUKUS partners will launch a series of AUKUS innovation challenges in which companies from across all three innovation ecosystems will be able to compete for prizes on a common innovation challenge topic. In early 2024, partners will launch the first trilateral Innovation Prize Challenge, focusing on electronic warfare. Defense Trade and Industrial Base Collaboration. The AUKUS partners are working to facilitate deeper and more rapid defense trade between the three nations by streamlining policies and processes, along with implementing comparable security standards for guiding the transfer of sensitive military technology, data, and know-how. These efforts, including proposed legislative changes, will increase private-sector cooperation across the AUKUS partners in emerging technologies and strengthen resiliency across our supply chains. AUKUS Advanced Capabilities Industry Forum. The AUKUS partners will establish and convene a standing Industry Forum with trilateral government and industry representatives to help inform policy, technical, and commercial frameworks to facilitate the development and delivery of advanced capabilities. The first meeting will occur in the first half of 2024. AUKUS Defense Investors Network. The AUKUS partners are increasing and expanding private sector engagement by welcoming the creation of an AUKUS Defense Investors Network, leveraging the current networks in all three countries to strengthen financing and facilitate targeted industry connectivity. Together, these activities enhance the AUKUS partners' capabilities, collective security, and deterrence amid an evolving strategic and security environment. The AUKUS partners remain committed to deepening trilateral collaboration, enhancing information and technology sharing, and integrating our defense industrial bases to further strengthen joint capabilities and increase resiliency across the three nations. The initiatives and accomplishments announced today advance these objectives and set the conditions for continued partnership and progress towards a bold and innovative future for AUKUS. aukus Austin Defense Secretary partnerships"

 "text": "I am deeply saddened by the passing of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the age of 100. He was the rare scholar turned strategist, and he has been widely hailed as one of our most powerful and influential secretaries of state. Dr. Kissinger led an extraordinary American life. In 1938, his parents fled virulent anti-Semitism in Hitler's Germany and began anew in New York City. This young refugee from Nazi Germany became the first and only American to simultaneously serve as both Secretary of State and Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Dr. Kissinger's involvement with the Department of Defense spanned from his service in the U.S. Army during World War II, when he was awarded a Bronze Star, to sitting on the Defense Policy Board late in his long life. In 2016, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter awarded Dr. Kissinger the Department's Distinguished Public Service Award, our highest civilian honor. At that ceremony, Secretary Carter noted that \"Henry Kissinger has demonstrated to each of us how serious strategic thinking and perspective can deliver pragmatic solutions to seemingly intractable problems.\" Dr. Kissinger served two Presidents and offered counsel to 10 more. I sought his geopolitical perspective repeatedly over the course of my career and always found our exchanges thought-provoking. On behalf of the Department of Defense, I extend my deep condolences to his wife Nancy, his children Elizabeth and David, and the entire Kissinger family. Austin Defense Secretary"

 "text": "U.S. Department of Defense and Philippine Department of National Defense spokespersons provided the following readout: Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III and Philippine Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro Jr met in Jakarta today on the margins of the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus. The Secretaries welcomed the historic momentum in U.S.-Philippine ties and discussed their mutual commitment to strengthening the U.S.-Philippine alliance, which has upheld peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region for over seventy years. They reaffirmed their countries' shared vision of a free and open region grounded in transparency, the rule of law, respect for sovereignty, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. Secretary Austin reiterated President Biden's message that the U.S. defense commitment to the Philippines is ironclad, and emphasized that the United States stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the Philippines in defending its sovereign rights and jurisdiction in its Exclusive Economic Zone. The Secretaries discussed the importance of preserving the rights of all nations to fly, sail, and operate safely and responsibly wherever international law allows. In this context, they denounced the recent harassment by vessels from the People's Republic of China (PRC) towards Philippine Coast Guard and resupply vessels conducting lawful resupply operations around Second Thomas Shoal, as well as dangerous operational PRC maneuvers against U.S. aircraft and ships lawfully operating in the South China Sea. Taking note of the concerns expressed about the PRC's recent harassment by a growing number of foreign governments globally, they also emphasized that the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal Ruling is final and binding on the Parties and called on the PRC to abide by its obligations under international law. The Secretaries reaffirmed that the Mutual Defense Treaty extends to both countries' armed forces, public vessels, and aircraft including those of its Coast Guard anywhere in the Pacific, to include the South China Sea. The Secretaries highlighted the recent progress the two countries have made to modernize the alliance, enhance interoperability, and address new and emerging challenges.

 "text": "U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Republic of Korea (ROK) Minister of National Defense Shin Wonsik, and Japanese Minister of Defense Kihara Minoru convened a Trilateral Ministerial Meeting on November 12, 2023. Secretary Austin and Minister Shin met in Seoul, South Korea, with Minister Kihara joining the meeting virtually. The leaders discussed shared regional security concerns and reviewed the implementation of trilateral security cooperation lines of effort agreed to at the historic Camp David Summit on August 18, 2023. During the meeting, the three leaders assessed regional security issues, including the growing nuclear and missile threats from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). In particular, the Secretary and the two Ministers strongly condemned the DPRK's space launch vehicle tests as they violate United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) that prohibit any launch using ballistic missile technology. The three leaders discussed ways to strengthen trilateral security cooperation to address these kinds of security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. The three leaders stressed the importance of the rules-based international order and expressed strong opposition to any unilateral actions that seek to alter the status quo by force or coercion. They reaffirmed their commitment to stand with Ukraine against Russia's unprovoked and brutal war of aggression, and recognized that Russia's actions are a serious violation of sovereignty that undermine the fabric of the international order. Additionally, the Secretary and the two Ministers emphasized the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to security and prosperity in the international community. They shared concerns on activities that are inconsistent with international law, in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and condemned recent dangerous activities against the vessels, ships, and aircraft operating in and over the East and South China Seas. The three leaders assessed that trilateral partnership between the United States, Japan, and the ROK is stronger than ever following the Camp David Summit and reviewed implementation progress for trilateral security cooperation initiatives announced at the summit. The Secretary and the two Ministers decided on a mechanism to facilitate the exchange of real-time missile warning data and improve each country's ability to monitor missiles launched by the DPRK. They confirmed that the data sharing mechanism is in the final stages of testing and agreed to fully operationalize the mechanism by the end of December. They also encouraged accelerated development of a multi-year trilateral exercise plan, which is currently being formulated to conduct trilateral exercises more systematically and efficiently and is scheduled to be finalized by the end of 2023. The Secretary and two Ministers noted the success of a trilateral aerial exercise held in October 2023 between the three countries and emphasized the importance of continuing these activities to demonstrate the three countries' strong will and capacity to respond to threats in the Indo-Pacific. Secretary Austin reaffirmed the United States steadfast alliance and extended deterrence commitments to Japan and the ROK backed by the full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. Minister Kihara and Minister Shin highlighted the importance of their bilateral ties in addition to trilateral cooperation to protect and advance their shared security goals. The Secretary and the Ministers committed to continue working closely together to ensure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.

So, we are working closely with the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that every veteran has a smooth transition to civilian life, that they receive the comprehensive health care that they have earned, and that they and their families receive the valuable assistance available through our programs and services. The Department has recently launched several major initiatives to take even better care of all of our people. We have lengthened paid parental leave to 12 weeks for all service members. We have made high-quality childcare on military installations more affordable and accessible. We have expanded service members' eligibility for Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts. And we will continue to make life easier and better for our service members and their families by supporting the careers of military spouses, making military moves easier, increasing service member pay, and securing affordable basic needs for our service members and their families. Our service members and veterans chose to put service before self. That ethos extends beyond their years in uniform. Many of our veterans continue to serve their communities after serving their country and enrich our democracy as leaders, teachers, coaches, mentors, and more. So to all our troops, veterans, and military families on this Veterans Day: Thank you for all that you have given to keep America safe. You have our deepest gratitude and our everlasting commitment to continue to uphold the values that you defended.

Chris Mahoney as Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps. They are outstanding leaders who have faithfully served their country for decades, and I know they will continue to be great leaders of our force as they continue to tackle the crucial national security issues of these challenging times. But we still have more than 370 superbly qualified leaders who have seen their nominations unnecessarily stalled. As we face a variety of urgent challenges, the most powerful fighting force in history must be at full-strength. This unprecedented delay in confirming our military s top leaders has hurt our military s readiness and unnecessarily weighed down our military families, who already give up so much to support those who serve. While today s vote is a step forward, we continue to urge the Senate to take swift action on the remaining nominations so that these American heroes can lead our team in keeping our country safe.

Austin III and Philippine Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro Jr spoke by phone yesterday. Secretary Austin reinforced U.S. support for the Philippines following the PRC Coast Guard and maritime militia's dangerous obstruction of a Philippine resupply mission to Second Thomas Shoal on October 22. The Secretaries discussed the incident on October 22, particularly the PRC's dangerous and unlawful maneuvers that caused collisions with Philippine resupply and Coast Guard ships, putting the safety of Philippine vessels and crew at risk. The Secretaries reaffirmed that the Mutual Defense Treaty extends to both countries' public vessels, aircraft, and armed forces to include the Coast Guard anywhere in the Pacific, to include the South China Sea. Both Secretaries committed to redouble efforts to strengthen bilateral coordination, interoperability, and support for the modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Secretary Austin reiterated the ironclad U.S. commitment to the Philippines and the Indo-Pacific region. The Secretaries commended recent bilateral military cooperation, including the bilateral sail last month off the coast of Palawan, and committed to increase the pace and scope of U.S.-Philippines engagements. The Secretaries look forward to meeting in person in Jakarta on the margins of the upcoming ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM)-Plus.

 "text": "Today, at President Biden s direction, U.S. military forces conducted self-defense strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups. These precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17. As a result of these attacks, one U.S. citizen contractor died from a cardiac incident while sheltering in place; 21 U.S. personnel suffered from minor injuries, but all have since returned to duty. The President has no higher priority than the safety of U.S. personnel, and he directed today s action to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests. The United States does not seek conflict and has no intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities, but these Iranian-backed attacks against U.S. forces are unacceptable and must stop. Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them. If attacks by Iran s proxies against U.S. forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people. These narrowly tailored strikes in self-defense were intended solely to protect and defend U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria. They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict. We continue to urge all state and non-state entities not to take action that would escalate into a broader regional conflict. Austin Defense Secretary syria"

That is why I stood up the Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee (SPRIRC) in 2021 and, after reviewing its thoughtful recommendations, took immediate action. I directed the Department to rapidly improve the delivery of mental health services to ensure that all of our teammates have easy access to the support that they need and deserve. In September 2023, I announced a suicide prevention campaign plan with five lines of efforts and over 100 enabling tasks modified from the SPRIRC's recommendations. There is no single solution to preventing suicide, but I remain focused on actions that will make a real difference and change the culture around this critical challenge. Together, we can prevent suicide and take care of every outstanding patriot who steps up to defend our country.

Their contributions have made our Armed Forces more representative of the American people, and better equipped to tackle future challenges. For decades, our LGBTQ+ Service members were forced to hide or were prevented from serving altogether. Even still, they selflessly put themselves in harm s way for the good of our country and the American people. Unfortunately, too many of them were discharged from the military based on their sexual orientation and for many this left them without access to the benefits and services they earned. Over the past decade, we ve tried to make it easier for Service members discharged based on their sexual orientation to obtain corrective relief. While this process can be difficult to navigate, we are working to make it more accessible and efficient. In the coming weeks, we will be initiating new outreach campaigns to encourage all Service members and Veterans who believe they have suffered an error or injustice to seek correction to their military records. The Department values the contributions LGBTQ+ Service members, veterans, and their families have made. I continue to encourage service members who were discharged when this policy was in effect to apply for a record correction through the Military Departments Discharge Review Boards and Boards for Correction of Military/Naval Records. One of my top priorities as the Secretary of Defense is to do right by our outstanding service members, military families, and civilian employees.

I am incredibly proud of the tireless work of this Department and our U.K. and Australian counterparts, and I am confident in the bright future of our historic partnership.

Just this year, the first Australian officers graduated from U.S. Nuclear Power School alongside America's most promising Sailors. Across the ocean, the submariners of USS North Carolina upheld our country's promise to increase rotations of attack submarines in Australia as the opening phase of the Optimal Pathway to support Australia's acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. And when we recently demonstrated the trilateral deployment of artificial intelligence-enabled assets, we proved that AUKUS can deliver on combined advanced capabilities. AUKUS is breaking down barriers to strengthen cooperation among the U.K. and Australia and their defense industries. With continued support from our U.S. interagency colleagues and Congress, I am confident that we will be able to realize the full potential of this groundbreaking partnership. AUKUS reaffirms our three democracies' bedrock commitment to an international system that upholds the rule of law and insists on the peaceful resolution of disputes, free from coercion, threats, or violence. At the very heart of this free and proud alliance are our people. Today, we not only celebrate this partnership but also the countless individuals who have shaped the success of AUKUS. As we commemorate this important milestone, I am deeply grateful to everyone involved in the AUKUS journey. We look forward to many more years of cooperation, growth, and solidarity.

Throughout America s longest war, our troops showed great courage and compassion. My thoughts today are with all of the brave Americans who answered the call to duty after al-Qaeda s terrorists attacked America including the Pentagon itself on September 11, 2001. We bow our heads today in memory of the 2,461 U.S. service members who never made it home, including the 13 courageous troops taken from us in the attack at Abbey Gate in the final hours of the war. We also remember the hundreds of service members from allied and partner countries who lost their lives during this 20-year war. And we honor the more than 20,000 Americans who were injured waging war in Afghanistan, including many who still bear wounds that are not visible. In the war s final days, the United States, along with our allies and partners, safely evacuated more than 124,000 civilians from Afghanistan, in the midst of the pandemic and in the teeth of danger. In recognition of teams that operated and excelled under these difficult and dangerous conditions, I am proud to announce the approval of the Presidential Unit Citation for the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Central Command, and Joint Task Force 82 of the 82nd Airborne Division and its supporting units. We remain deeply committed to supporting the Afghan allies who fought by our sides and to helping those who are now building new lives outside their troubled homeland. We will continue to push to help resettle our Afghan allies, and I am proud that we have welcomed more than 115,000 Afghans who stood by our side to the United States over the past two years. Today, our hearts and our prayers are with the brave Americans who volunteered to keep our country safe, with the Gold Star families whose loved ones fell in Afghanistan, with the military families who endured so much over those two decades, and with the veterans who still carry the memories and the scars of war. The war in Afghanistan is over, but our gratitude to the Americans who fought it is unending. Austin Defense Secretary Afghanistan"

Together, they resolved to preserve international laws and norms, enhance our mutual security and defense capabilities, and remain guided by our shared democratic principles. They shared their determination to further strengthen our relationship, ensuring that it is robust and capable of seizing future opportunities and tackling emerging challenges in an increasingly complex geopolitical climate. Shared Vision Minister Prabowo and Secretary Austin agreed that the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and the United States' Indo-Pacific Strategy share fundamental principles, such as a commitment to maintaining peace, security, stability, and prosperity in the region through ASEAN Centrality, and that we should work alongside partners who share these goals and a commitment to an open, inclusive, and rules-based order. They shared the view that the People's Republic of China's (PRC) expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea are inconsistent with international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Secretary Austin and Minister Prabowo jointly condemned violations of national sovereignty, as reflected in United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1 dated 2 March 2022, as adopted by majority vote, which deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine. Stronger Partnership As the United States and Indonesia move into the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, Minister Prabowo and Secretary Austin reaffirmed that our defense partnership is stronger than ever. They highlighted that the United States and Indonesia hold more than 220 defense engagements annually, from subject-matter expert exchanges to multilateral exercises with thousands of troops, all demonstrating the breadth of our interoperability. They discussed how, in recent years, we have expanded Exercise GARUDA SHIELD from a bilateral army-to-army exercise to a joint, multinational exercise with over nineteen countries represented, and they committed to seek further opportunities for expansion. Together, Secretary Austin and Minister Prabowo reaffirmed the importance of Indonesia's military modernization and discussed both countries' mutual intention to deepen interoperability through defense capabilities like fighter aircraft upgrades, new multi-role fighter aircraft, and additional fixed and rotary wing transport aircraft. Shared Values Secretary Austin and Minister Prabowo also discussed the commitment by the United States and Indonesia, as two of the world's largest democracies, to the rule of law and the professionalization of our armed forces. They highlighted that for the first time this year, there were Indonesian cadets in the Army, Air Force, and Naval service academies. Minister Prabowo expressed his appreciation for the education of more than 7,000 Indonesian military personnel and civilians in the United States, as well as training and education funds that have been provided to Indonesian students by the United States, totaling more than $130 million since 1970. Going forward, as part of our professionalization efforts, Minister Prabowo and Secretary Austin pledged to work together to promote civilian harm mitigation best practices. They also discussed how our efforts to mitigate and respond to civilian harm directly reflect our values and directly contribute to mission success and public confidence in the armed forces.

The Ukrainian people have inspired the world with their courage and resolve to defend their right to live in a sovereign, democratic, and free country. For the past 18 months, Russia has waged a full-scale, unprovoked, and indefensible war against Ukraine. The Kremlin's war of choice has killed thousands of innocent Ukrainians, displaced millions more, and deliberately inflicted terror and trauma on Ukraine's men, women, and children. Yet the Ukrainian people remain indomitable, and Ukraine is fighting back valiantly to regain its sovereign territory and protect its citizens. The United States is proud to stand with Ukraine, and we will continue to ensure that it has what it needs to fight for its freedom. Under President Biden's leadership, we have built a strong global coalition in support of Ukraine and committed more than $43 billion in security assistance that has been critical to helping Ukraine since Russia launched its reckless and lawless invasion. We have provided air defense to protect Ukraine's skies, as well as artillery, tanks, armored vehicles and associated munitions, anti-armor weapons, and more to help Ukraine's defenders counter Russian aggression. To support Ukraine's current counteroffensive, our latest assistance package included key capabilities, such as additional mine-clearing equipment, armored vehicles, and artillery rounds. Nations of goodwill from around the globe have also stepped up to condemn Russia's assault on the international system of rules and rights and rushed urgently needed assistance to Ukraine. Some 50 countries of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group that I convene have rallied to commit more than $32 billion in security assistance to support Ukraine's defense. Today, as Ukraine commemorates another year of independence, the United States remains steadfast in our commitment to ensure that it can celebrate many more.

 "title": "Joint Statement on Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) 2023",
 "text": "The Governments of Australia and the United States of America released the following statement on the occasion of the 33rd Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN). Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Richard Marles hosted the U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on 29 July in Brisbane to advance the Australia-U.S. Alliance and their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and globally. Building on the high tempo of engagement between leaders and ministers, including the meeting between Prime Minister Albanese and President Biden in May 2023, the Ministers and Secretaries (the principals) determined that the Alliance has never been stronger. Based on a bond of shared values, it remains a partnership of strategic interest premised on a common determination to preserve stability, prosperity, and peace. All four principals acknowledged the traditional custodians of the land upon which AUSMIN took place and highlighted the ancient and enduring links between Australia's First Nations people and Country. They committed to ensuring the voices of First Nations people are heard at the international level, and to draw on their knowledge and experience to address shared challenges, such as climate change. They committed to work together to elevate Indigenous People's business interests, including through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and bilateral initiatives. Shaping an Open, Stable and Prosperous Indo-Pacific, Together The principals committed to expand collaboration bilaterally and with regional partners and institutions, principally ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum to ensure an Indo-Pacific that is open, stable, peaceful, prosperous, and respectful of sovereignty, human rights, and international law. They committed to further enhance engagement in the Indo-Pacific underpinned by regional partner priorities such as economic and social development, climate change cooperation, security, connectivity, good governance, timely and effective humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, health security, and resilience initiatives. The principals underscored the vital importance of all states being free to exercise rights and freedoms consistent with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including freedom of navigation and overflight and rights to manage and develop marine resources. They reiterated their strong opposition to destabilising actions in the South China Sea, such as unsafe encounters at sea and in the air, the militarisation of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, and efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource development. The principals committed to maintaining the steady and long-term presence of Australian and U.S. aircraft and vessels, consistent with international law and in partnership with Southeast Asian and other states, to promote stability and security in the region's vital international waterways, including the South China Sea. They also committed to strengthen their support in building the capability of Southeast Asian partners to manage their maritime domains. The principals further expressed concern about the People's Republic of China's (PRC) excessive maritime claims that are inconsistent with international law and unilateral actions that have raised tensions in the region. The principals reaffirmed the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award as final and binding on the parties. The principals also expressed serious concerns about the situation in the East China Sea they shared an intention to remain in close communication about the situation there and expressed strong opposition to any destabilising or coercive unilateral actions that increase tensions in the area, undermining peace and stability. The principals reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and their shared opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo. They called for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues through dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion. They emphasised Taiwan's important role as a leading Indo-Pacific economy and democracy and reiterated their commitment to work together to support Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organisations, to deepen economic, trade, and people-to-people ties and committed to enhance development coordination with Taiwan in the Pacific. The principals emphasised the imperative for all countries to manage strategic competition responsibly. Australia expressed support for renewed U.S. efforts to establish reliable and open channels of communication with the PRC to manage strategic competition and guard against conflict. The principals encouraged the PRC to engage constructively with the United States and to take steps to promote stability and transparency. They affirmed the importance of cooperating with the PRC to address issues of global and shared interest including climate change, global food and nutrition security, trade, and macroeconomic stability. The principals noted that Southeast Asia was critical to regional stability and underscored their commitment to work together and with likeminded partners to support Southeast Asia's economic, development and security priorities. They reaffirmed their commitment to ASEAN centrality and ASEAN-led regional architecture including the East Asia Summit (EAS), the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus. They emphasised the role of the EAS as the region's premier leaders' forum for addressing strategic challenges and expressed their ongoing support for the practical implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. They expressed support for Indonesia's priorities as 2023 ASEAN chair and extended their support to Laos as the ASEAN chair in 2024. They repeated their support for Timor-Leste's accession to ASEAN and committed to implement their respective Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships with ASEAN. The principals reiterated their support for ASEAN-led efforts to respond to the ongoing crisis in Myanmar, and their deep concern for the deteriorating situation. They again urged the Myanmar military regime to implement its commitments under the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus, refrain from violence, release all those unjustly detained, and allow unimpeded humanitarian access. They called for the international community to sustain international pressure on the regime, and urged all countries to avoid lending credibility or military support to the regime as it continues its brutality against the people of Myanmar. The principals emphasised their commitment to working with Pacific Island Countries through existing regional architecture, recognising the centrality of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and to support the objectives of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. They would continue to consult and be guided by Pacific priorities and encouraged other partners to similarly pursue best practice engagement that is transparent and places Pacific interests first. The principals reaffirmed their confidence that Partners in the Blue Pacific (PBP) is enhancing capacity for likeminded countries to coordinate and pool resources in support of the priorities and needs of Pacific Island Countries. They agreed to work closely with PBP partners towards delivering initiatives on climate action, cyber capacity-building, and humanitarian warehousing. The principals committed to pursue further joint financing for sustainable, resilient infrastructure in the region. Australia welcomed U.S. commitment to explore new grant funding for infrastructure projects in the Pacific, and its intent to further develop sovereign financing capacity to meet critical infrastructure needs in the region. They noted their commitment to the Blue Dot Network (BDN) to certify projects that have met global standards for quality infrastructure development, assisting developing countries to better attract private sector investment and close the infrastructure gap. The principals committed to leverage in consultation with Pacific Island Countries the planned deployment of a USCG Cutter to the Pacific in early 2024 to further maritime domain awareness and training in the region and to address maritime security priorities including illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The principals affirmed their commitment to jointly expand support for Pacific law enforcement and justice sector actors to secure maritime borders, combat transnational crime, and promote the rule of law in accordance with the Boe Declaration on Regional Security and the PIF's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. They welcomed deepened cooperation between Australian, Pacific and U.S. law enforcement agencies to improve maritime law enforcement and domain awareness, law enforcement capacity building, border security, and capacity to combat transnational organised crime, cybercrime, money laundering, corruption, and trafficking. The principals reaffirmed their commitment to enhance interoperability with the militaries of the Pacific, including through Exercises CORAL WARRIOR and CARTWHEEL in Fiji, and Exercise PUKPUK in Papua New Guinea (PNG). They welcomed Fiji, Indonesia, PNG, and Tonga's participation in Exercise TALISMAN SABRE 2023 for the first time, as well as India, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines as observers of the largest bilateral military training activity between Australia and the United States. The principals discussed deepening Quad cooperation between Australia, the United States, India and Japan, in support of an open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. They welcomed Australia's hosting of the 2023 Quad Leaders' Summit in Hiroshima, where Quad Leaders announced practical initiatives on climate change and clean energy, infrastructure and connectivity, critical and emerging technology, and health security in response to regional priorities. They welcomed the continued progress of the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness now in its pilot phase which is helping to build a more accurate picture of maritime activities and enable responses to IUU fishing, bringing increased transparency to the region. The United States thanked Australia for its leadership in the Quad in 2023, and the principals affirmed their support for India's hosting of the 2024 Quad Leaders' Summit. The principals welcomed the growing development cooperation across their two systems in the Indo-Pacific and globally, including on development programming, climate and development financing, infrastructure, and health security. The principals welcomed the signing of an MOU between Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the U.S. Agency for International Development to facilitate joint pre-positioning of humanitarian supplies in Australia and PNG, enabling more effective humanitarian responses in the region. The principals reiterated their commitment to achieving gender equality and advancing the human rights of all women and girls, in all their diversity, globally and through initiatives in the Indo-Pacific. They welcomed the inaugural annual Australia-U.S. Strategic Dialogue on Gender Equality held in June 2023, and their commitment to collaborate on implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda, ending all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, advancing gender equality in trade and progressing women's economic empowerment. The principals expressed their continued grave concern about severe human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang, the erosion of religious, cultural, educational and linguistic rights and freedoms in Tibet, and the systematic erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic institutions, including through the introduction of the National Security Law and the decision of Hong Kong authorities to issue arrest warrants for democracy advocates who no longer live in Hong Kong. They strongly condemned ongoing human rights violations and abuses in Iran, including the persecution of women and girls, aggressive suppression of civil society and discriminatory treatment of ethnic and religious minorities. They also strongly condemned the Taliban for their egregious human rights abuses, particularly the systemic and all-encompassing denial of women and girls exercising their human rights. They expressed a shared commitment to standing with the people of Iran and Afghanistan, particularly women and girls. Driving Climate Action and the Transition to Clean Energy The principals committed to deepening cooperation to address the climate crisis through the implementation of the Australia-United States Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact announced by Prime Minister Albanese and President Biden in May 2023. They reaffirmed the existential threat posed by climate change and underscored the importance of working together to mitigate its global impacts. This aligns with the shared goal of keeping a global average temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach. The principals acknowledged clean energy transformation as fundamental to global climate action and reaffirmed the important role of the Compact in enhancing integration between Australia and U.S. clean energy and critical minerals industries to unlock economic growth, drive down emissions, and build regional energy security. They recognised the importance of the Quad Statement of Principles on Clean Energy Supply Chains and Quad Clean Energy Supply Chains Diversification Program in facilitating a coordinated approach to the clean energy transition in the Indo-Pacific. The United States welcomed Australia's bid to host COP31 with Pacific partners. The principals reiterated their unwavering support for the Pacific in dealing with the impacts of climate change which present daily challenges for, and have a disproportionate impact on, communities and governments in the region. Recognising this, they agreed it was vital to accelerate implementation of the Compact as soon as possible, including by supporting the preparatory work for the Pacific Resilience Facility. Building on the establishment of the Senior Officials' Working Group on Climate Security Risk, the principals committed to strengthening coordination on climate security initiatives, such as enhanced information sharing, collaboration on climate risk assessments, and the integration of climate considerations into existing military exercises and planning. The principals reiterated their commitment to strengthen coordination with regional partners on climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience, especially in consideration of those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including women, girls, and First Nations people. They will continue to share expertise on climate finance and clean energy investment, including development of potential new and innovative financial approaches to increase private investment into the region's net zero transition and resilience needs. The principals also agreed on the need to provide greater opportunities for First Nations people to contribute to and benefit from the clean energy transition, noting their unique expertise in environmental management. Defence and Security Cooperation The principals reaffirmed their shared commitment to operationalise the Alliance, including through Enhanced Force Posture Cooperation. They underscored that their cooperation was based on a foundation of trust, a long record of achievement and a shared vision for upholding an open and stable international order. They recalled the Force Posture Agreement, which recognises the mutual benefits to Australia and the United States from access to facilities and areas in Australia by the United States Armed Forces for activities and that such access and use is on a rotational basis, as mutually determined, and at the invitation of Australia, with full respect and observance of both Australia and U.S. sovereignty. The principals reaffirmed their commitment to deliver the ambitious trajectory of Enhanced Force Posture Cooperation across land, maritime, and air domains, as well as the Combined Logistics, Sustainment and Maintenance Enterprise (CoLSME). They declared Enhanced Space Cooperation as a new Force Posture Initiative to enable closer cooperation in this critical operational domain. They also announced their intent to increase space integration and cooperation in existing operations and exercises. The principals affirmed their intention to continue to progress upgrades at key Australian bases in the north, including RAAF Bases Darwin and Tindal, supported by site surveys to scope additional upgrades at new locations, RAAF Bases Scherger and Curtin. Through Enhanced Air Cooperation, they announced their intent to rotate U.S. Navy Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft in Australia to enhance regional maritime domain awareness, with an ambition of inviting likeminded partners to participate in the future. Through Enhanced Maritime Cooperation, the principals noted their intention to conduct more regular and longer visits of U.S. SSNs from 2023 to Australia, with a focus on HMAS Stirling. These visits would help build Australia's capacity in preparation for Submarine Rotational Force-West, an important milestone for the AUKUS Optimal Pathway that would commence as early as 2027. The principals affirmed their intent to enable a regular rotation of U.S. Army Watercraft in Australia, commencing with participation in Exercise TALISMAN SABRE this month, and noted the benefits for interoperability and regional engagement. Through the CoLSME, Australia and the United States announced their intent to conduct a proof of principle prepositioning of U.S. Army stores and materiel in Bandiana, Australia following Exercise TALISMAN SABRE 2023. This is a precursor to the longer-term establishment of an enduring Logistics Support Area in Queensland designed to enhance interoperability and accelerate the ability to respond to regional crises. The principals welcomed the commitment at the Australia, Japan and U.S. Trilateral Defense Ministers' Meeting in June to develop a roadmap for enhanced trilateral cooperation in Australia. The roadmap will develop concrete proposals for trilateral cooperation that will increase Japanese participation in exercises and training related activities in Australia including F-35 Joint Strike Fighter training and cooperation. Enhancing trilateral interoperability is an important investment in credible, effective deterrence. Building upon intent shared at this year's Trilateral Defense Ministerial Meeting, the principals agreed to enhance trilateral Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) cooperation with Japan, including through involvement of attendees from all three countries in their respective bilateral IAMD policy discussions, where appropriate. As the United States develops its enhanced IAMD architecture on Guam and elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region, the principals affirmed their intent to work together closely to identify areas and activities where bilateral cooperation can be expanded, including strengthened operational collaboration on IAMD-related military exercises. The principals committed to explore opportunities to further deepen cooperation with partners, including Japan, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Republic of Korea, noting the dividend for security and stability in the Indo-Pacific. The principals agreed to establish Combined Intelligence Centre Australia within Australia's Defence Intelligence Organisation by 2024. The Centre would further enhance the long-standing intelligence cooperation between the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation and the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, focused on analysing issues of shared strategic concern in the Indo-Pacific. Shared Commitment to Global Security The principals committed to upholding a global order based on international law, including the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. They condemned Russia's unlawful and immoral war against Ukraine, and again called on Russia to immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw its forces from within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine. The principals emphasised that Russia's war is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy. They condemned Russia's weaponisation of food, including its decision to end its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative and its continued attacks on Ukrainian agriculture and export infrastructure. The principals called on all those with influence on Russia, particularly China, to exert it now to end the war. They noted Russia's nuclear threats were a serious and unacceptable menace to international peace and security, and that the use of nuclear weapons would be met with resolute responses by the international community. The principals denounced Iran's destabilising behaviour, including its wrongful detention of foreign and dual nationals and targeting, intimidation, and harassment of dissidents overseas, its nuclear-related expansions, proliferation of ballistic missiles, support for armed proxies, and threats to shipping and freedom of navigation in the Gulf. They also condemned Iran's provision of drones to Russia for use in Russia's war against Ukraine. The principals strongly condemned the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) unprecedented series of unlawful ballistic missile launches since 2022 and continued development of its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs which are prohibited by multiple UN Security Council resolutions. They noted with grave concern continuing reports of severe violations of human rights in the DPRK. They noted with concern reports that the DPRK was conducting increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges to raise illicit funds for these programs and called for the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula consistent with UN Security Council resolutions. They further encouraged the DPRK to immediately return to constructive dialogue. The principals committed to enhance cooperation to prevent proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, and to strengthen the global multilateral non-proliferation architecture, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation and disarmament regime and the IAEA safeguards system, including through working to promote universal adoption of the Additional Protocol. The principals reiterated shared concerns about the increased scale and severity of malicious cyber activity and committed to hold to account those that engage in unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace. The principals reiterated their support for the UN Open Ended Working Group and the UN Programme of Action to advance responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and protect an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful cyberspace founded upon international law and norms. They also underscored their ambition for the UN Open-Ended Working Group on Reducing Space Threats through Norms, Rules, and Principles of Responsible Behaviours to produce outcomes and recommendations in its final session in August that will bolster security, transparency, stability, predictability, and trust in outer space. The principals reiterated their shared commitment to the safe and ethical development of critical technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum. Australia congratulated the Biden-Harris Administration for securing the eight voluntary commitments from industry to manage the risks posed by AI and noted that it is currently reviewing its regulatory framework for AI. Securing Our Technological Edge The principals reaffirmed the importance of maximising the strategic and technological advantage of the Alliance by combining strengths and pooling resources in an age of heightened strategic competition. They lauded the progress made since the last AUSMIN in December 2022 to streamline defence trade controls and information sharing between the two countries. The principals reiterated their joint commitment to security standards to safeguard sensitive technology and information. The Governments of Australia and the United States are examining their export control regimes to streamline the flow of defence trade. The principals committed to collaborate on critical technologies and innovation to ensure the Alliance's asymmetrical capability edge and to explore opportunities for regional co-development, co-production, and co-sustainment aligned to agreed capability priorities. They welcomed opportunities for future collaboration between Australia's Advanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator and the U.S. Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency and Strategic Capabilities Office including on synergies for planned capability programs. The principals agreed to deepen cooperation on Australia's Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise by collaborating on a flexible guided weapons production capability in Australia, with an initial focus on the potential for co-production of Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems by 2025. This is key to expanding the combined industrial power of the Alliance and to building Australia's industrial infrastructure and skilled workforce. The principals reaffirmed their commitment to address global supply chain constraints and to transfer technical data for the M795 155mm artillery shell in support of future production in Australia. They reaffirmed their commitment to progress the maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade of priority munitions in Australia, noting this would enhance supply chain resilience, with an initial focus on MK-48 heavyweight torpedoes and SM-2 missiles. The principals welcomed progress under the AUKUS partnership towards Australia's acquisition of a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability and the development of advanced capabilities to safeguard stability and security in the Indo-Pacific. They reaffirmed their commitment to transparency and urged others to take a similar approach to their capability development. The principals reaffirmed their commitment to set the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard. The United States reiterated its confidence that the non-proliferation approach Australia is developing in consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency would set the strongest precedent for the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine capability. The principals recognised the strong progress made to implementing the AUKUS Optimal Pathway since it was announced, including the establishment of the Australian Submarine Agency on 1 July 2023. They welcomed the embedding of Australian Government personnel within the U.S. submarine industrial base and Australians deployed on U.S. submarines as a way for Australia to progressively develop the skills, knowledge, and expertise required to operate, maintain, and steward nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS Optimal Pathway. Developing Trusted Regional Trade Infrastructure and Resilient Supply Chains to Build Economic Resilience The principals reiterated their commitment to a rules-based international trading system. They opposed economic coercion in all its forms and recognised the importance of multilateral institutions and norms which promote free, fair, and open international trade. The principals look forward to the substantial conclusion of negotiations for the remaining IPEF agreements on trade, clean economy, and fair economy, in support of IPEF's vision for a free and open, connected, prosperous, resilient, inclusive, and secure Indo-Pacific region. Working together with 12 other IPEF partners, Australia and the United States seek to address economic challenges and opportunities, including through high-standard commitments related to trade, supply chains, clean energy, and anti-corruption and tax. They affirmed their commitment to ensuring that IPEF delivers for everyone. They commended the substantial conclusion of negotiations for the IPEF Supply Chains Agreement and reaffirmed their respective commitment to quick implementation in order to deliver concrete benefits as soon as possible. The principals welcomed the collaboration and progress made during the United States' APEC host year, including at the APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade Meeting and the Transportation Ministerial Meeting. They highlighted and acknowledged the importance of APEC as the premier economic forum in the region, which aims to create greater prosperity for the people of the region including by advancing a free, fair, and open trade and investment environment, sustainable economic growth, and women's economic empowerment, and building a more interconnected, innovative, and inclusive APEC region. They also agreed to continue to work cooperatively toward the successful conclusion of the APEC year, including at the APEC Ministerial Meeting and the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting this November. The principals highlighted their ongoing cooperation to build their shared economic security and economic resilience in a time of heighted competition. They recognised the value of the annual Australia-U.S. Strategic Commercial Dialogue to advance our shared geoeconomic and commercial interests across the nexus of economic, foreign, and national security policy. The United States looks forward to hosting the next AUSMIN in 2024. Australia aukus partnerships Indo-Pacific Talisman Sabre"

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the 70th National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day",
 "text": "Seventy years ago today, on July 27, 1953, after more than three years of war on the Korean Peninsula, military leaders from the United States, North Korea, and the People's Republic of China signed the Korean Armistice Agreement to \"insure a complete cessation of hostilities.\" All Americans should remember the terrible cost of the Korean War and the valor of those who fought against aggression, facing fierce adversaries, harsh terrain, and pitiless conditions. More than 36,000 U.S. troops were killed in action, along with hundreds of thousands more from the Republic of Korea and partner nations serving in the United Nations Command. Even today, some 7,000 American service members from this war remain unaccounted for. We have a solemn duty to continue looking for answers for American families whose loved ones still remain missing in action seven decades on. America also has a sacred responsibility to take care of our Korean War veterans, their families, their caregivers, and their survivors, and to ensure that they get the benefits they deserve. When President Eisenhower told the American people that the armistice had been signed, he said, \"We shall fervently strive to insure that this armistice will, in fact, bring free peoples one step nearer to their goal of a world at peace.\" So it has. During each of my three visits to the Republic of Korea as Secretary of Defense, I have seen firsthand its thriving democracy, dynamic economy, and innovative minds in action all a living testament to the shared sacrifices of families in both of our countries. I have also had the privilege of spending time with the American troops stationed there, who proudly keep the peace and serve alongside South Korean service members. Seventy years after the signing of the armistice, and the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty that followed soon after, our ironclad alliance is stronger than ever. In the words of our alliance motto, \"We go together\" and we will continue to do so, shoulder to shoulder. Defense Secretary Austin Indo-Pacific korean war"

 "title": "Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III's Statement Marking 75 Years Since the Desegregation of the Department of Defense",
 "text": "Seventy-five years ago today, President Truman ordered the desegregation of the U.S. Armed Forces and the civilian workforce across the U.S. government. That historic step made the U.S. military stronger and made America better. For far too much of our nation's history, service members of color who fought to defend our country were forced to serve in segregated units. Black troops were denied the very rights that they fought to defend. Despite this bitter heritage, segregated units demonstrated their skill and mettle in war after war. During World War II alone, more than one million Black Americans served bravely to defeat fascism. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, President Truman rightly declared, \"The only limit to an American's achievement should be his ability, his industry, and his character.\" On July 26, 1948, President Truman issued two Executive Orders to enshrine that deeply American principle, mandating \"equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.\" The end of segregation throughout the Department of Defense was a major step toward fulfilling America's founding promises of liberty and equality under law. Since then, our extraordinary military and our dedicated civilian workforce have welcomed qualified patriots from all racial backgrounds to defend our country and serve alongside one another. Today, some 44 percent of our active-duty, all-volunteer force are Americans of color. The U.S. military is the finest fighting force on Earth because of our strategic advantages: we can draw on the talents and the strengths of skilled and brave Americans of every color, creed, and background. As we reflect on the tremendous progress that our country has made over the past 75 years, we recommit ourselves to continue the noble work of all those who broke down barriers, fought prejudice, and worked to ensure that America's peerless military embodies the democratic ideals that it so proudly defends. service Defense Secretary Austin desegregation"

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the 50th Anniversary of America's All-Volunteer Force",
 "text": "Fifty years ago, the United States military began to fill its ranks solely with brave Americans who freely choose to defend our republic. Ever since the draft ended on July 1, 1973, Americans have joined our military out of conviction, not compulsion. Over the years, the members of our All-Volunteer Force have been motivated by patriotism, pride, and principle by the desire to be a part of something bigger than themselves, and by their love for our exceptional nation. Moving to an All-Volunteer Force was a bold step: No other military with such formidable capabilities had operated on a voluntary basis. But history has proven the wisdom of relying on our All-Volunteer Force, and the combination of moral and military power that it has brought has strengthened our armed forces. Over the past five decades, our military has recruited and retained patriotic and talented personnel from all walks of American life, resulting in a more professional and effective Joint Force. Today, America's All-Volunteer Force is the strongest military in human history, and it sets the global standard for military professionalism. As Americans build their lives around a free commitment to military service, they grow into leaders. They hone their skills as soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardians but also as doctors, mechanics, teachers, and computer technicians. And they pass on their knowledge to future generations of Service members. The All-Volunteer Force shows us how much Americans can do when we commit ourselves to serve others, give back to our communities, and make our country more secure and more just. The United States has a sacred obligation to take care of every patriot who has ever worn the cloth of our nation, as well as their families. We reaffirm that commitment as we proudly salute each American who selflessly raises their hand to serve our country and defend our republic. Today and every day, the service of the members of our All-Volunteer Force is a testament to their courage and to the power of our democracy. Austin Defense Secretary service prioritizing people"

 "title": "United States-Japan-Republic of Korea Trilateral Ministerial Meeting (TMM) Joint Press Statement",
 "text": "U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Japanese Minister of Defense Hamada Yasukazu, and Republic of Korea (ROK) Minister of National Defense Lee Jong-Sup convened a Trilateral Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, June 3, 2023. During the meeting, the three leaders discussed the growing nuclear and missile threats from the Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK) as well as efforts to enhance trilateral security exercises and address common security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. The Secretary and the two Ministers pledged that the United States, Japan, and the ROK will cooperate closely toward their shared commitment to achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). They shared their deep concerns about, and condemnation of, the DPRK s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, which pose a grave threat to international peace and stability, and they committed to address these concerns through concerted trilateral cooperation. In particular, the Secretary and the two Ministers condemned DPRK s recent claimed space launch using ballistic missile technology as it constitutes a serious violation of relevant UNSCRs. They also renewed their determination to respond firmly to the DPRK threat through increased trilateral cooperation as well as cooperation with the international community. Additionally, they called for full implementation by the international community of relevant UNSCRs. They underscored the importance of sustained international efforts to deter, disrupt, and ultimately eliminate the DPRK s illicit ship-to-ship transfers. They urged the DPRK to immediately cease its irresponsible actions that create tension on the Korean peninsula and in the region, and to abide by its obligations under all relevant UNSCRs. In line with the commitments made by U.S. President Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida, and ROK President Yoon at the Phnom Penh Summit on November 13, 2022, the Secretary and the two Ministers recognized trilateral efforts to activate a data sharing mechanism to exchange real-time missile warning data before the end of the year in order to improve each country s ability to detect and assess missiles launched by DPRK. The Secretary and the two Ministers discussed the ongoing progress being made through technical working-level consultations and noted that this is a major step for deterrence, peace and stability. They also pledged to make further progress toward operationalizing the trilateral mechanism initially over the next few months. The Secretary and the two Ministers further affirmed the three sides will utilize the 2014 U.S.-Japan-ROK Trilateral Information Sharing Arrangement to facilitate coordination and cooperation among all three sides. They also welcomed the recent normalization of the bilateral General Security of Military Information Agreement between Japan and the ROK. In addition, they concurred on the need to contribute to defense-related confidence building measures among the countries in the region and committed to strengthening cooperation to institutionalize such efforts. The Secretary and the two Ministers discussed other regional security issues as well as DPRK threats and all reiterated the importance of deepening trilateral cooperation on key issues to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, including information sharing, high-level policy consultations, and trilateral exercises. They further discussed steps to follow up on these issues. Additionally, the Secretary and the two Ministers affirmed their commitment to swiftly conduct maritime interdiction exercises and anti-piracy exercises, and they pledged to further identify other areas, including disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, where the three countries intend to expand trilateral cooperation. They committed to regularizing defensive exercises that contribute to strengthening trilateral responses to the DPRK's nuclear and missile threats and deterring against those threats, including anti-submarine exercises and missile defense exercises. The Secretary and the two Ministers stressed the importance of the rule of law and expressed strong opposition to any unilateral actions that seek to alter the status quo by force or coercion and increase tensions in the region. They reaffirmed their commitment to stand with Ukraine against Russia s unprovoked and brutal war of aggression and to recognize that Russia s actions are a serious violation of territorial integrity and sovereignty which undermines the fabric of the entire international order. They emphasized the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. They shared concerns on activities that are inconsistent with international law, in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and stressed the importance of fully respecting international law, including freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea. The United States reaffirmed its steadfast alliance commitments to Japan and the ROK backed by the full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear. Japan and the ROK highlighted the importance of their bilateral ties and trilateral cooperation to protect and advance their shared security goals. The Secretary and the two Ministers committed to work closely together for peace and stability in the region and around the world.

 "text": "This Pride Month, we honor the service, commitment, and sacrifice of the LGBTQ+ Service members and personnel who volunteer to defend our country. Their proud service adds to America's strength. Their contributions to our national security are powerful. Members of this community have deployed to combat zones around the globe, held high-ranking positions in the Pentagon, and fought and died alongside their teammates. To defend our republic and win its wars, the ranks of the U.S. military must remain open to all qualified patriots who seek to serve. Militaries that do not avail themselves of the best possible talent of their citizenry put themselves at a strategic disadvantage. We would be rendering ourselves less fit to our weighty task if we excluded from our ranks people who meet our standards and who have the skills, the guts, and the devotion to serve in uniform. I believe that the story of America should be one of widening freedom, not deepening discrimination. In 2021, I was honored to implement President Biden s directive to ensure that transgender Americans who wish to serve and meet Department standards are able to do so openly and free from discrimination. This often painful history has made something clear: Who you love and how you identify has nothing to do with how bravely you can fight for your country. When we speak up for the rights of all Americans, when we encourage all qualified Americans to stand a post, we strengthen both our democracy and our national security. The U.S. military is the greatest fighting force in history, and we intend to keep it that way. As Secretary of Defense, I remain dedicated to making sure that our LGBTQ+ personnel across the Joint Force can continue to serve the country that we all love with dignity and pride this month and every other one. We thank you for your service and we thank your spouses and your families, whose support makes your service possible. Austin Defense Secretary lgbtq community pride"

 "text": "I enthusiastically support President Biden s decision to nominate Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr., as the 21st Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Brown is an outstanding joint warfighter and a thoughtful, strategic leader who will bring his trademark skill, talent and judgment to this critical role, if confirmed. During his 39 years of service to our nation, Gen. Brown has excelled as a fighter pilot, military strategist, and senior commander. He has served as both instructor and commandant at the elite Air Force Weapons School. From serving as a wing commander in South Korea and Italy to pioneering innovative operational concepts as the Pacific Air Forces commander, Gen. Brown has developed the expertise, the vision, and the warfighting acumen to help the President and senior DoD leaders navigate today s toughest national security challenges. In his tenure leading the U.S. Air Force, he has been a model of strategic clarity and a powerful force for progress. I saw his talents firsthand when I was the commander of CENTCOM. General Brown served as the commander of Air Forces Central, my air component. He superbly led forces in combat during the air campaign against ISIS and rallied a broad coalition of allies and partners to help shatter the group s self-styled caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Gen. Brown is an inspiring and effective leader and a man of deep integrity and compassion. Throughout his career, he has insisted on doing right by his teammates and their families. As Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the first Black leader of a U.S. military service he has worked hard to draw upon the strength and talents of all of the American people and to give our Service members and their loved ones the support that they deserve. On behalf of the entire Department, I am grateful to Gen. Brown s wife, Sharene, and their sons, Sean and Ross, for everything they have done to support this outstanding warfighter and leader. I thank Gen. Brown for his lifetime of service and his willingness to shoulder this weighty new responsibility. I look forward to his wise counsel and to serving alongside him to keep America strong, safe, and secure. Let me also applaud the distinguished service of our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Mark Milley. He has been a reliable partner in challenging times, and I am thankful for his counsel, his vision, and his unflagging love of country. Our nation and our military are stronger because of his superb leadership and sound advice. I am grateful to him and his wife Hollyanne for their service and selflessness.

 "text": "Over the course of 20 years of war in Afghanistan, our Service members and their families served bravely, selflessly, and with compassion. As the Secretary of Defense and as a veteran of the Afghanistan war, I am proud of and deeply grateful for the men and women who stood up to serve after Al Qaida attacked us on September 11th, 2001. We remember the 2,461 American Service members and personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice in this war. Even on the hardest days, including August 26, 2021 when we tragically lost 13 of our finest, our force performed admirably under incredibly challenging conditions. The Department of Defense is a learning organization that routinely conducts After Action Reviews to make our brave troops safer in the future. In December 2021, I directed an independent AAR to provide a detailed assessment of DoD implementation of U.S. Afghanistan policy from January 2020 through August 2021. The purpose of the AAR was to examine decision points, constraints, and assumptions in order to contribute toward a whole-of-government effort to learn, improve, and incorporate lessons learned into our response to future crises. The AAR provided the Department with key insights on issues like planning, interagency coordination, and communication with allies and partners. This review was an important step to inform future DoD decision-making, and we will continue to support other reviews, including the Afghanistan War Commission s efforts to review the full 20 years of the war. I strongly believe that a thoughtful and comprehensive examination of the entirety of America s longest war by the Commission will be an important contribution to the nation. Today, we are making the classified AAR available to members of relevant congressional committees. The Department is committed to working with Congress and our partners across government to continue identifying the lessons learned from this process and turning them into meaningful action. And I will always be proud of and forever grateful to the men and women who served their country in Afghanistan, and for the skill and professionalism our American Service members brought to the job every single day.

 "text": "Today, I was honored to join President Biden, Australian Prime Minister Albanese, and U.K. Prime Minister Sunak as they announced the AUKUS Optimal Pathway, a commitments-based, phased plan for Australia to acquire conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines. This is the next step forward in the transformational partnership among our three great democracies. In September 2021, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom laid out an ambitious vision for our countries that will strengthen our combined military capabilities, boost our defense industrial capacity, enhance our ability to deter aggression, and promote our shared goal of a free and open Indo-Pacific. AUKUS is a shared, long-term investment that will allow us to build defense advantages that endure for decades to come. One of the most important parts of this partnership is increasing each of our countries submarine capabilities. Under the first phase of the Optimal Pathway, the United States and the United Kingdom will immediately increase port visits of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines in Australia and then, as early as 2027, will begin rotating through Australia under Submarine Rotational Force-West. In the next phase, the United States intends to sell three Virginia-class submarines to Australia in the 2030s, with the potential to sell up to two more if needed. Finally, Australia and the United Kingdom will develop and deploy SSN-AUKUS, a new conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine that incorporates critical U.S. technologies. Each phase of the Optimal Pathway will set the highest nuclear nonproliferation standards. We re also working to strengthen our countries industrial bases; to eliminate barriers to information-sharing and technological cooperation; and to develop and deliver advanced capabilities in such areas as artificial intelligence, hypersonics, and maritime domain awareness. All these investments will allow us to work more closely with our valued and highly capable allies to deter aggression in the Indo-Pacific a region whose future is crucial for U.S. national security and the rules-based international order that makes us all safer. I would like to thank the many public servants in all three proud democracies whose hard work has made this historic announcement possible. I look forward to working with my team and with our Australian and British counterparts to continue to move toward our shared vision of a stable, secure Indo-Pacific and an open world of rules and rights. aukus Austin Defense Secretary Indo-Pacific"

 "title": "Department of Defense Releases the President's Fiscal Year 2024 Defense Budget",
 "text": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the President's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget \"The FY 2024 budget is the most strategy-driven request we've ever produced from the Department of Defense. And as our National Defense Strategy makes clear, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is our pacing challenge. This budget seeks to meet this critical challenge today, tomorrow, and into the future by providing the resources today to continue to implement our National Defense Strategy and keep our nation safe while delivering a combat credible Joint Force that is the most lethal, resilient, agile, and responsive in the world. As the PRC races to modernize its military, this budget will sharpen our edge by making critical investments across all timeframes, theaters, and domains. Among numerous important actions that bolster our combat credibility in the short term, this budget makes the Department's largest-ever investments in readiness and procurement and our largest investment in research and development. To sustain our military advantage over China, it makes major investments in integrated air and missile defenses and operational energy efficiency, as well as in our air dominance, our maritime dominance, and in munitions, including hypersonics. This budget includes the largest ever request for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which we are using to invest in advanced capabilities, new operational concepts, and more resilient force posture in the Indo-Pacific region. It also enables groundbreaking posture initiatives in Guam, Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Japan, and Australia. We are also investing in resiliency in key parts of the defense supply chain to ensure stability in the industrial base's ability to produce what the Joint Force needs. That includes working closely with Congress to secure multi-year procurement authorities and allow us to meet the needs of tomorrow. And this year's budget also increases funding to continue modernizing all three legs of our nuclear triad to maintain a safe, secure, and effective strategic deterrent against advanced and persistent threats around the world. The United States has the strongest military in the world because we have the best team in the world. And we owe it to the brave men and women who serve to take care of our people and their families. So this budget includes the largest military and civilian pay raise in decades, and it builds on progress we've already made to make life a little easier by lowering every day costs, including by reducing the cost of goods in the commissary and making childcare more accessible and affordable. As the Secretary of Defense, my priority will always be to ensure that our forces are ready and resilient, and that our military remains the world's preeminent fighting force, today, tomorrow, and for generations to come. I look forward to working with Congress to support the President's request.\" On March 9, 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration submitted to Congress a proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget request of $842 billion for the Department of Defense (DoD), an increase of $26 billion over FY 2023 levels and $100 billion more than FY 2022. The FY 2024 Defense Budget is driven by strategy and provides us with the capabilities and investments to advance the Secretary's three key priorities: defending the nation, taking care of our people, and succeeding through teamwork. To achieve these priorities, this budget request links strategy to resources to continue executing our 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), which aligns with the President's National Security Strategy. These guiding documents determine the vision and direction of the Department of Defense in what the President has called the \"decisive decade.\" The NDS outlines the Department's defense and security priorities: Defending the homeland, paced to the growing multi-domain threat posed by the People's Republic of China (PRC). Deterring strategic attacks against the United States, our allies, and our partners. Deterring aggression, while being prepared to prevail in conflict when necessary - prioritizing the PRC challenge in the Indo-Pacific region, then the Russia challenge in Europe. Building a resilient joint force and defense ecosystem. The NDS positions the U.S. military to meet growing threats through integrated deterrence, campaigning, and taking actions that build enduring advantages. The FY 2024 DoD budget request of $842 billion enables the Department to successfully advance these defense and security goals by purposefully aligning resources to best position our warfighters, allies, and partners for success. Integrated Deterrence The FY 2024 President's Budget allows the DoD to invest in capabilities that will ensure we maintain a ready, lethal, and combat-credible joint force with a laser focus on China as the Department's pacing challenge and addressing the acute threat posed by Russia. The budget makes critical investments to revitalize the defense industrial base, drive innovation, and take care of our people. The FY 2024 budget request once again includes a record investment in research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) of $145 billion. This budget also funds $170 billion for procurement, the largest in history. Combined, these investments will ensure combat-credible forces across all domains. Secretary Austin has called deterrence the \"cornerstone of defense.\" In FY 2024, the DoD supports the concept of Integrated Deterrence by ensuring combat-credible forces and a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent. Investments across all domains include: $61.1 billion for air power to continue developing, modernizing, and procuring lethal air forces, including a focus on fighters, including F-22, F-35, F-15EX; the B-21 bomber, mobility aircraft, including KC-46A; specialized support aircraft; and unmanned aircraft systems. $48.1 billion for sea power including new construction of nine battle force fleet ships and continued funding for the incremental construction of Ford class nuclear powered aircraft carriers and Columbia ballistic missile submarines. $13.9 billion for land power supporting modernization of Army and Marine Corps combat equipment: Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, Amphibious Combat Vehicle, and Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle. $37.7 billion for Nuclear Enterprise Modernization, including: Continued development and procurement of the B-21 program - $5.3 billion. Production of the second Columbia ballistic missile submarine - $6.2 billion. First year advance procurement funding for the LGM-35A Sentinel program. Development efforts supporting nuclear command, control, and communications systems. $29.8 billion to enhance Missile Defeat and Defense, including: Development of the Next Generation Interceptor for Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, and extending the service life of the current interceptor fleet. Increased investments in regional missile defense network with Patriot Missiles, a Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor, additional Short-Range Air Defense Battalions, and hypersonic weaponry and defenses. Development of a resilient overhead persistent infrared capability in low earth orbit and medium earth orbit, and continuing to field the Next Generation Polar program. Integration of the THAAD Battery capability into the Army's Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System planning process, and continuing development of the eighth THAAD Battery. Advanced innovation technologies and demonstrations, including those involving cyber operations and hypersonic strike capabilities. Defense of Guam against the missile threat from China - $1.5 billion. $11.0 billion to deliver a mix of highly lethal precision weapons. Investments include: Continued development, testing, and procurement of hypersonic missiles and other long-range fires. Extensive hypersonic prototyping efforts. Procurement of 24 hypersonic missiles. Maximizing Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, and Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, and Standard Missile 6 capacity through multi-year procurements. $33.3 billion in vital space capabilities, resilient architectures, and enhanced space command and control. Investments include: Development of new proliferated resilient missile warning / missile tracking architectures, Next-Gen Overhead Persistent Infrared space and associated ground architectures - $5.0 billion. Position, navigation, and timing for GPS III Follow-On satellite support and Next-Generation Operational Control System development - $1.3 billion. 15 launch vehicles and launch range upgrades - $3.0 billion. Protected Tactical, Wideband, and Narrowband robust secure/survivable/jam-resistant capabilities, and Space Development Agency proliferated Low Earth Orbit Transport Layer development - $4.7 billion. Campaigning The budget prioritizes ongoing force readiness, ensuring the urgent competing demands of the present are carefully balanced with preparing for the future. The Department's FY 2024 budget continues to prioritize joint force readiness, investing $146.0 billion to strategically build and maintain warfighting forces and capabilities. Investments to fund a high level of force readiness include: Army readiness - $28.8 billion. Navy readiness - $52.8 billion. Marine Corps readiness - $4.4 billion. Air Force readiness - $39.9 billion. Space Force readiness - $3.3 billion. U.S. Special Operations Command readiness - $9.7 billion. Joint Capabilities - $7.1 billion. The FY 2024 budget includes $9.1 billion in support of the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI), a 40 percent increase from FY 2023. The effort includes resilient and distributed air basing, new missile warning and tracking architecture, construction to enable enhanced posture, funding for defense of Guam and Hawaii, and multinational information sharing, training, and experimentation. In Europe, the FY 2024 budget allows the Department to continue to counter Russian aggression against NATO allies and partners. Investments include: European Deterrence Initiative - $3.6 billion. NATO Military Contribution - $601.0 million. NATO Security Investment Program - $293.0 million. Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative - $300.0 million. Building Enduring Advantages As highlighted in both the NSS and NDS, the Department's people are its most valuable asset. The DoD aims to support its all-volunteer military and civilian workforce by focusing on economic stabilization and supporting families. Investments to Take Care of People include: 5.2 percent pay increase for military and civilian personnel, the highest pay raise in over 20 years for our military and over 40 years for our civilians. $193.0 million to ease military moves, through enhancements for lodging expenses and dislocation allowances.

 "text": "Today, on International Women's Day, the Department of Defense recognizes the tremendous, enduring contributions that women Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen, Guardians, and civilian employees have made in service to our country. From America's first days, women have made profound sacrifices for our republic. They have made innovative contributions to our national security, blazed trails for future generations, and inspired us with their dedication, skill, and patriotism. Since the Revolutionary War, more than three million women have stepped up to serve their country in uniform, even before the military fully recognized their service. This year, we mark the 75th anniversary of the Women's Armed Services Integration Act, which paved the way for women to officially serve in all U.S. military branches, and the 10th anniversary of opening all combat roles to women. The logic behind these decisions was clear and compelling: Our military needs the best warfighters in every domain. That remains true today. Though the Department has made significant progress to break down stubborn barriers for women in the U.S. military, we know that we still have more to do to promote inclusion and well-being and to give all our teammates the opportunity to rise to their full potential. I am personally committed to this vital work. To ensure that we continue to have the strongest fighting force in the world, we must draw on the full power of all our people. On this International Women's Day and every day, our country thanks the patriots in our extraordinary All-Volunteer Force for the sacrifices that they make to build a stronger, safer, and more secure world.

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III Marking One Year Since Russia's Invasion of Ukraine",
 "text": "One year ago today, Russia launched an unprovoked and indefensible invasion of its peaceful and democratic neighbor Ukraine a cruel war of choice that has killed thousands of innocent Ukrainians, forced millions more from their homes, left countless Ukrainians wounded or traumatized, and inflicted tragedy and terror on a sovereign U.N. member state. Today's solemn anniversary is an opportunity for all who believe in freedom, rules, and sovereignty to recommit ourselves to supporting Ukraine's brave defenders for the long haul and to recall that the stakes of Russia's war stretch far beyond Ukraine. The United States has rallied the world to support Ukraine and hold Russia accountable. Under President Biden's leadership, the United States has committed more than $32 billion in game-changing security assistance to Ukraine over the past year. This includes more than 1,600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; more than 8,500 Javelin anti-armor systems; 232 howitzers and more than two million rounds of artillery ammunition; 38 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and ammunition; a Patriot air-defense battery; eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) and other key air-defense capabilities; 109 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles; 31 Abrams tanks; and 90 Stryker Armored Personnel Carriers. We have done all this with bipartisan backing in Congress and with the proud support of the American people. The United States has also rallied nations of goodwill from around the planet to condemn Russia's aggression and rush urgently needed assistance to Ukraine. The engine of our efforts is the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, an extraordinary coalition of some 50 countries that I convene regularly to coordinate support to Ukraine's defenders. Our allies and partners in the Contact Group have committed more than $20 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, including hundreds of tanks, thousands of other armored vehicles, vital air-defense systems, hundreds of artillery systems, and other crucial capabilities. In response to the most urgent danger to European security since the end of World War II, we have moved swiftly with our allies to further unify and strengthen NATO. The Alliance has bolstered its defenses on the Eastern Flank. Meanwhile, the United States has deployed or extended more than 20,000 additional U.S. forces to Europe and forward-stationed the first permanent U.S. forces on NATO's Eastern Flank. NATO is more united than ever, and the U.S. commitment to defend every inch of allied territory remains ironclad. One year into a war of aggression waged by a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, our allies and partners worldwide stand united and resolute. Putin's reckless, illegal war is not just an all-out assault on Ukraine's sovereignty and a historic threat to European security. It is also a direct attack on the system of rules, institutions, and laws that the world built at such great cost after World War II a system that rejects aggression and respects the rights of all countries, big and small. Putin thought that Ukraine's defenses would collapse, that America's resolve would falter, and that the world would look the other way. He was wrong. One year later, Ukraine's brave defenders have not wavered, and neither has our commitment to support them for as long as it takes. Despite the Kremlin's campaign of cruelty, the people of Ukraine have shown stunning bravery, skill, and fortitude. Today and every day, we stand by the courageous Ukrainians fighting to defend their country, and we mourn with those who have lost their loved ones in Moscow's monstrous and unnecessary war. Difficult times may lie ahead, but let us remain clear-eyed about what is at stake in Ukraine. And let us remain united in purpose and in action and steadfast in our commitment to ensure that a world of rules and rights is not replaced by one of tyranny and turmoil. ukraine response NATO Defense Secretary Austin"

 "text": "This afternoon, at the direction of President Biden, U.S. fighter aircraft assigned to U.S. Northern Command successfully brought down the high altitude surveillance balloon launched by and belonging to the People's Republic of China (PRC) over the water off the coast of South Carolina in U.S. airspace. The balloon, which was being used by the PRC in an attempt to surveil strategic sites in the continental United States, was brought down above U.S. territorial waters. On Wednesday, President Biden gave his authorization to take down the surveillance balloon as soon as the mission could be accomplished without undue risk to American lives under the balloon's path. After careful analysis, U.S. military commanders had determined downing the balloon while over land posed an undue risk to people across a wide area due to the size and altitude of the balloon and its surveillance payload. In accordance with the President's direction, the Department of Defense developed options to take down the balloon safely over our territorial waters, while closely monitoring its path and intelligence collection activities. This action was taken in coordination, and with the full support, of the Canadian government. And we thank Canada for its contribution to tracking and analysis of the balloon through NORAD as it transited North America. Today's deliberate and lawful action demonstrates that President Biden and his national security team will always put the safety and security of the American people first while responding effectively to the PRC's unacceptable violation of our sovereignty.

 "text": "ROK Minister of National Defense Lee Jong-Sup and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III held a defense ministerial meeting on January 31, 2023 in Seoul. This was the fourth meeting between the two leaders and the first meeting of 2023, which marks the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK Alliance. During the meeting, the two leaders strongly condemned the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) continued provocations and violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions, including its missile launches and recent drone incursions. They also affirmed that the ROK-U.S. Alliance, along with the international community, will continue to take a strong stance against any further provocations by the DPRK. The Minister and the Secretary jointly reaffirmed measures to enhance the implementation of U.S. extended deterrence to underscore the U.S. security commitment to the ROK. As agreed upon during the ROK-U.S. Summit in May 2022 and the 54th Security Consultative Meeting, the two leaders emphasized that the two nations will continue to bolster the Alliance's capabilities to deter and respond to DPRK nuclear and missile threats, as well as to enhance information sharing, joint planning and execution, and Alliance consultation mechanisms. The two leaders reaffirmed that the two sides will make substantive progress in completing the revision of the Tailored Deterrence Strategy (TDS) before this year's SCM. The ROK Ministry of National Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense will hold the Deterrence Strategy Committee Table-top Exercise (DSC TTX) in February, in order to facilitate Alliance discussions on deterrence and response options to deal with the DPRK nuclear threat. Furthermore, the two sides concurred that the recent combined air exercises, conducted in late 2022 and involving U.S. strategic bombers, demonstrated a range of deterrence capabilities of the U.S.-ROK Alliance. The two leaders additionally pledged to closely cooperate in order to continue to deploy U.S. strategic assets in a timely and coordinated manner in the future. The two leaders also pledged to further expand and bolster the level and scale of this year's combined exercises and training. To this end, the two leaders concurred on the need to take into account changes in the security environment, including the DPRK's recent steps with respect to its nuclear and missile programs, to strengthen combined exercises and training, including the upcoming combined bilateral exercises. Both leaders agreed to expand the scope and scale of combined field training exercises and to conduct a large-scale combined joint fires demonstration this year. Minister Lee and Secretary Austin also discussed measures to strengthen regional security cooperation including ROK-U.S.-Japan trilateral security cooperation. The two leaders committed to following up on developing specific courses of action to facilitate trilateral sharing of missile warning data, as agreed by the three countries' leaders at the November 2022 Phnom Penh Summit. Minister Lee and Secretary Austin also concurred that this topic would be addressed at a future meeting of the Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT). To this end, they agreed to hold Defense Trilateral Talks (DTT) at the earliest opportunity to discuss concrete measures on how to strengthen security cooperation among the three nations. Based on a shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, the two leaders pledged to work towards aligning the respective U.S. and ROK Indo-Pacific strategies and exploring avenues of cooperation with partners in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Finally, in light of the 70th anniversary of the ROK-U.S. Alliance and the Armistice Agreement, the two leaders resolved to continue to strengthen the Alliance and ensure it contributes to security in the region and around the world. The Minister and the Secretary also pledged to strengthen solidarity with United Nations Command Member States that share core values with the ROK and U.S. to promote security on the Korean Peninsula. In this light, Secretary Austin welcomed the ROK's proposal for a ROK-UNC Member States Defense Ministerial Meeting in 2023. Austin Defense Secretary South Korea Indo-Pacific Indo-Pacom partnerships"

Al-Sudani was responsible for fostering the growing presence of ISIS in Africa and for funding the group s operations worldwide, including in Afghanistan. This action leaves the United States and its partners safer and more secure, and it reflects our steadfast commitment to protecting Americans from the threat of terrorism at home and abroad.

 "text": "Seventy-five years ago this year, President Truman signed an executive order banning segregation in the U.S. Armed Forces. And nearly 60 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his immortal \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Today, the United States has the strongest fighting force in history. Our diverse, formidable, 21st-century military shows how much progress America has made toward Dr. King's vision of full citizenship for all Americans. We are proud and thankful for every patriot in our extraordinary, all-volunteer force. Our ranks are comprised of Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Guardians, and DoD civilians from all walks of life, representing every color, gender, ethnicity, and creed from across our great nation. These American warriors protect our country every hour of every day and defend U.S. interests around the globe. Today's U.S. military is simply the finest, most combat-capable fighting force that the world has ever known. Dr. King's call to action still reminds us that the great American experiment of democracy, freedom, and equal rights requires us all to come together in a spirit of citizenship and service. Yet as a nation, we also know we still have much more to do to ensure equal rights, liberty, and justice for all. As Dr. King famously said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" As we commemorate this year's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, I encourage all of us to reflect on how far we've come, but also on the important work that we have left to do.

 "title": "Joint Statement of the 2023 U.S.\u2013Japan Security Consultative Committee (\"2+2\")",
 "text": "Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Defense Austin, Minister for Foreign Affairs Hayashi, and Minister of Defense Hamada (referred to collectively as \"the Ministers\") convened the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (SCC) in Washington, D.C., on January 11, 2023. Recognizing the convergence of their nations' new national security and defense strategies toward bolstering deterrence in an integrated manner, the Ministers provided a vision of a modernized Alliance postured to prevail in a new era of strategic competition. The Ministers firmly reiterated their commitment to champion a free and open Indo-Pacific region, heralding the U.S.-Japan Alliance as the cornerstone of regional peace, security, and prosperity. They resolved to advance bilateral modernization initiatives to build a more capable, integrated, and agile Alliance that bolsters deterrence and addresses evolving regional and global security challenges. The Ministers affirmed that the Alliance is stalwart in the face of these challenges and steadfast in support of shared values and norms that underpin the international rules-based order. They renewed their commitment to oppose any unilateral change to the status quo by force regardless of the location in the world. The Ministers welcomed the release of their respective National Security Strategies and National Defense Strategies, and confirmed unprecedented alignment of their vision, priorities, and goals. This forms a solid foundation for their efforts to constantly modernize the Alliance in order to address the increasingly severe security environment. Japan reiterated its resolve, under its new strategies, to fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities, including counterstrike, through a substantial increase of its defense budget. Japan also reaffirmed its determination to lead in its own defense and to expand its roles, in cooperation with the United States and other partners, to actively engage in maintaining regional peace and stability. The United States expressed its strong support for Japan's updated national security policies as a significant evolution that bolsters Alliance deterrence. The United States expressed its determination to optimize its force posture in the Indo-Pacific, including in Japan, by forward-deploying more versatile, resilient, and mobile capabilities. Japan supported the U.S. plan to optimize its force posture and welcomed its strong commitment to maintain a robust presence in the region. The United States restated its unwavering commitment to the defense of Japan under Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear. The Ministers held an in-depth discussion on U.S. extended deterrence for Japan, as well as on the recently released U.S. Nuclear Posture Review, and reaffirmed the critical importance of ensuring U.S. extended deterrence remains credible and resilient, bolstered by Japan's capabilities. They reiterated both countries intend to deepen the substantive discussions at the Extended Deterrence Dialogue as well as through various senior-level meetings. In accordance with their new strategies, the Ministers decided to accelerate work on evolving Alliance roles and missions and to employ interoperable and advanced capabilities, to address current and future security challenges. The Ministers also resolved to jointly strengthen Alliance activities with allies and partners within and beyond the region. A New Era of Strategic Competition The Ministers concurred that China's foreign policy seeks to reshape the international order to its benefit and to employ China's growing political, economic, military, and technological power to that end. This behavior is of serious concern to the Alliance and the entire international community, and represents the greatest strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The Ministers reiterated their strong opposition to China's intensified attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force in the East China Sea, including through actions that seek to undermine Japan's longstanding administration of the Senkaku Islands. The United States reaffirmed that Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty applies to the Senkaku Islands. The Ministers condemned China's dangerous and provocative military activities around Japan, including China's ballistic missile launches in August 2022, during which some missiles landed in waters near Japan's Sakishima Islands. They shared their continuing concerns regarding China's ongoing and accelerating expansion of its nuclear arsenal, which is also characterized by its lack of transparency. They also reiterated their strong objections to China's unlawful maritime claims, militarization of reclaimed features, and threatening and provocative activities in the South China Sea. The Ministers reaffirmed their support for unimpeded lawful commerce and full respect for international law, including freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea. In this context, they recalled with emphasis that the July 12, 2016, Award in the South China Sea Arbitration (The Republic of Philippines v. The People's Republic of China), constituted under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS), is final and legally binding on the parties to that proceeding. They confirmed, also in this context, that they will work together closely to address non-market policies and practices as well as economic coercion. The Ministers stated that their basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged, and reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community. They encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. They expressed serious concerns about the state of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms as well as human rights issues, including in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The Ministers strongly condemned North Korea's unprecedented number of unlawful and reckless ballistic missile launches over the past year, including of multiple intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)-class missiles, and of the ballistic missile that overflew Japan. They expressed strong concern over North Korea's stated policy to enhance its nuclear arsenal at maximum speed, both in quality and quantity, and reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of North Korea. The Ministers urged North Korea to abide by its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions and confirmed the need for an immediate resolution of the abductions issue. The Ministers also committed to deepen cooperation between and among the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, which is critical to addressing the grave threat North Korea presents and to promoting security, peace, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. The Ministers strongly condemned Russia's brutal, unprovoked, and unjustifiable war against Ukraine. They recognized that Russia's violation of the UN Charter and its attempts to unilaterally change borders by force, including through its ongoing aggression against Ukraine, present a serious security threat for the European region and shake the foundation of the international order. The Ministers condemned Russia's reckless nuclear rhetoric and its attacks against civilian infrastructure, and they reiterated the need for Russia to be held accountable for its atrocities in Ukraine. The Ministers also highlighted with concern Russia's growing and provocative strategic military cooperation with China, including through joint operations and drills in the vicinity of Japan. Modernizing the Alliance In light of evolving Alliance roles and missions, and enhancing interoperable capabilities to meet the aforementioned security challenges, the Ministers decided to accelerate their consultations, including on the following areas: Alliance Coordination The Ministers reemphasized the necessity to further enhance bilateral coordination through the Alliance Coordination Mechanism in order to cope with the full spectrum of possible situations in a timely and integrated manner. In this context, the United States welcomed Japan's decision to establish a permanent joint headquarters. They committed to exploring more effective Alliance command and control relationships to enhance interoperability and responsiveness. The Ministers also shared the need to improve effective coordination with partner countries for more robust policy and operational cooperation. Allied Efforts in Peacetime The Ministers underscored the critical importance of joint efforts in peacetime to deter an armed attack against Japan and destabilizing activities in the region. They decided to deepen bilateral coordination, including on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and flexible deterrent options. They welcomed the U.S. deployment of MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicles to Kanoya Air Base and the launch of the Bilateral Information Analysis Cell to increase intelligence sharing. In order to maximize the effects of these efforts, they decided to further expand their cooperation in the field of asset protection missions, broader engagement of partners, and strategic messaging. They welcomed the joint/shared use of additional facilities on Kadena Ammunition Storage Area by JSDF. They also committed to expand joint/shared use of U.S. and Japanese facilities and to increase bilateral exercises and training in areas including Japan's Southwest Islands. The Ministers stressed the importance of flexible use of air and seaports to ensure the resiliency of defense assets and their operational effectiveness in a contingency. Accordingly, they decided to work together through exercises and planning to enable such use. Allied Capability to Deter and Respond The Ministers concurred that Alliance efforts, consistent with new strategy documents, should focus on mission areas such as integrated air and missile defense, anti-surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, mine warfare, amphibious and airborne operations, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting (ISRT), logistics, and mobility. They decided to deepen bilateral cooperation toward the effective employment of Japan's counterstrike capabilities in close coordination with the United States. The Ministers welcomed the steady progress on bilateral planning for contingencies as well as on realistic training and exercises such as Keen Sword 23, Resolute Dragon 22, Orient Shield 22, and MV-22 low altitude training. The Ministers underscored the critical importance of strengthened cross-domain capabilities, particularly integrating the land, maritime, air, space, cyber, electromagnetic spectrum, and other domains. Space, Cyber, and Information Security Recognizing the growing importance of outer space to the peace, security and prosperity of the Alliance, the Ministers renewed their commitment to deepening cooperation on space capabilities to strengthen mission assurance, interoperability, and operational cooperation, including through enhanced collaboration in space domain awareness after the operationalization of Japan's Space Situational Awareness system scheduled in 2023. The Ministers consider that attacks to, from, or within space present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance, and affirmed such attacks, in certain circumstances, could lead to the invocation of Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. The Ministers also affirmed that a decision as to when such an attack would lead to an invocation of Article V would be made on a case-by-case basis, and through close consultations between Japan and the United States, as would be the case for any other threat. The Ministers emphasized the foundational importance of cybersecurity and information security for the Alliance. They welcomed the establishment of JSDF Cyber Defense Command in March 2022, and concurred to intensify collaboration to counter increasingly sophisticated and persistent cyber threats. The United States welcomed Japan's initiatives to bolster its national cybersecurity posture such as the creation of a new organization to coordinate whole-of-government cybersecurity policies, and the introduction of a risk management framework, which would provide a foundation for a wider range of U.S.-Japan cooperation. The Ministers welcomed progress in strengthening industrial cybersecurity, including Japan's efforts to establish the Standards on Cybersecurity Measures for Defense Industry. Lastly, the Ministers highlighted important progress made so far under the bilateral information security consultations. Maintaining the Technological Edge Emphasizing the importance of integrating technological developments into Alliance capabilities, the Ministers committed to bolster technology cooperation and joint investments in emerging technologies to further sharpen the competitive edge of the Alliance. The Ministers also emphasized that resilient, diverse, and secure supply chains of defense equipment are essential to ensure national security. In this regard, the Ministers welcomed the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Projects and the Security of Supply Arrangement as well as the substantial progress on the Reciprocal Government Quality Assurance. With these achievements as well as steady progress on defense science and technology cooperation, including discussions on joint research projects on high-power microwaves and autonomous systems, the Ministers concurred to further promote their efforts toward joint research and development of defense equipment. Based on the progress of joint analysis on counter-hypersonic technology, the Ministers concurred to begin joint research on important elements including advanced materials and hypersonic testbeds. The Ministers also concurred to begin discussion on potential joint development of a future interceptor. The Ministers also shared the importance of deepening technological cooperation with like-minded allies and partners, which complements bilateral efforts. Expanding Alliance Partnerships The Ministers renewed their commitment to further advance their partnership with Australia by building on outcomes from the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue in August 2022 and Trilateral Defense Ministers Meeting in June and October 2022 and by taking advantage of the expanding activities under the Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation signed in October 2022. In this context, they highlighted the successful completion of the first coordinated asset protection mission among the three countries in November 2022. They also expressed their determination to increase trilateral training and exercises to enhance interoperability, including on ISR, as well as to explore opportunities for technological cooperation. In this context, they reaffirmed the importance of increasing trilateral training opportunities including in northern Australia, based on the Joint Statement on Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations issued in December 2022. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to supporting quality, transparent infrastructure development that addresses the needs of Indo-Pacific partners and welcomed the renewal of the Trilateral Infrastructure Partnership MOU with Australia. The Ministers also emphasized the importance of further deepening their cooperation with the Republic of Korea and exploring opportunities for multilateral and trilateral exercises and other activities, including in areas such as ballistic missile defense, anti-submarine warfare, maritime security, search and rescue, and humanitarian assistance/disaster relief. The Ministers reaffirmed their strong support for ASEAN's unity and centrality and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. They acknowledged the importance of further promoting economic and security cooperation with partners in Southeast Asia and Pacific Island countries through such activities as joint training, capacity building, and potential transfers of defense equipment. The Ministers welcomed further cooperation under the Partners in the Blue Pacific Initiative, which will support the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. The Ministers reconfirmed the importance of the Quad, which has made positive contributions to the region through promoting practical cooperation in various fields. Noting that likeminded nations are facing similar, and mutually-reinforcing threats to the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions, the Ministers welcomed greater engagement in the Indo-Pacific by Euro-Atlantic partners both bilaterally and through multilateral entities such as NATO and the EU. They expressed support for expanded exercises and deployments, facilitated by Japan's new bilateral agreements including forthcoming Reciprocal Access Agreements with Australia and the United Kingdom. The United States endorsed Japan's efforts to finalize its NATO Individually Tailored Partnership Program, and welcomed Japan's enhanced emphasis on European security through its provision of assistance to Ukraine. The United States likewise hailed Japan's increased cooperation with NATO, and Japan's leadership role in NATO's Asia Pacific partners' group. From this perspective, the United States welcomed Prime Minister Kishida's attendance at the NATO Summit in Madrid in June 2022 the first time a Japanese Prime Minister has participated in a NATO Summit. Optimizing Alliance Posture The Ministers affirmed the need to optimize Alliance force posture based on improved operational concepts and enhanced capabilities to address increasing security challenges in the region, including for the defense of the Southwestern Islands of Japan. Facing a severely contested environment, they confirmed that the forward posture of U.S. forces in Japan should be upgraded to strengthen Alliance deterrence and response capabilities by positioning more versatile, resilient, and mobile forces with increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, anti-ship, and transportation capabilities. In line with such policy, the Japan-U.S. Roadmap for Realignment Implementation, as adjusted by the SCC on April 27, 2012, will be readjusted so that the 3rd Marine Division Headquarters and the 12th Marine Regiment will remain in Okinawa. The 12th Marine Regiment will be reorganized into the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment by 2025. The Ministers reiterated their commitment to the basic tenets of the 2012 Realignment Plan, and confirmed that these readjustments do not affect the lands scheduled to be returned in the Okinawa Consolidation Plan, nor continued progress for the Futenma Replacement Facility at Camp Schwab. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to achieve an end-state for the U.S. Marine Corps presence in Okinawa consistent with the levels envisioned in the Realignment Roadmap as revised in 2012. The Ministers also confirmed that these readjustments do not require any changes to Japan's cash contribution and construction projects based upon the amended Guam International Agreement. To further strengthen Alliance maritime mobility in Japan, the Ministers welcomed the establishment of the Composite Watercraft Company at Yokohama North Dock scheduled in 2023. The Ministers affirmed that these initiatives demonstrate the steadfast commitment of the United States to the defense of Japan and share the same direction with Japan's fundamental reinforcement of its defense capabilities. They confirmed that the optimized posture of the U.S. forces in Japan, with enhanced JSDF capabilities and posture in areas including the Southwestern Islands, would substantially strengthen Alliance deterrence and response capabilities. The Ministers decided to continue close consultation on these initiatives and ways to further optimize U.S. force posture in Japan. The Ministers also reconfirmed the steady implementation of ongoing projects supporting realignment of facilities and areas of U.S. Forces in Japan and the importance of relationships with local communities. The Ministers underlined their commitment to continue construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility at the Camp Schwab/Henokosaki area and in adjacent waters as the only solution that avoids the continued use of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. The Ministers welcomed the progress and future prospects for the development of the SDF facility on Mageshima, which will be used for purposes including Field Carrier Landing Practice. They confirmed the importance of accelerating bilateral work on U.S. force realignment efforts, including construction of relocation facilities and land returns in Okinawa, and the relocation of Marine Corps personnel from Okinawa to Guam beginning in 2024. The Ministers affirmed the importance of continued bilateral coordination for sharing timely information on incidents and accidents, enhancing environmental cooperation, as well as mitigating impacts on, and supporting strong relationships with, local communities while communicating with them about the importance of Alliance activities.

We support Japan's decision to acquire new capabilities that strengthen regional deterrence, including counterstrike capabilities. We also endorse Japan's decision to increase substantially its defense spending and reach two percent of GDP in 2027, and to improve the jointness and interoperability of its Self-Defense Forces through the creation of a permanent joint operational headquarters.

Austin III hosted the Honourable Richard Marles MP, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, Australia, and the Right Honourable Ben Wallace, Secretary of State for Defence, United Kingdom, at the Pentagon today to discuss the Australia-United Kingdom-United States Security Partnership (AUKUS). The Secretary of Defense, Deputy Prime Minister, and Secretary of State for Defence reviewed the significant progress to date on the trilateral effort to support Australia s acquisition of conventionally-armed, nuclear powered submarines and the trilateral development of advanced capabilities. They emphasized that AUKUS will make a positive contribution to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region by enhancing deterrence. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister expressed their confidence in continued progress ahead of the end of the 18-month consultation period regarding naval nuclear propulsion and announcement on the optimal pathway by the President and Prime Ministers in early 2023. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister highlighted the exceptional progress that has been made on trilateral efforts to identify the optimal path for Australia to acquire conventionally-armed, nuclear powered submarine capability at the earliest possible date. They reiterated their shared commitment to set and uphold the highest standards for nuclear nonproliferation, and welcomed the ongoing, extensive and productive engagement that has been carried out with the International Atomic Energy Agency to date. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister endorsed efforts to orient capability development to accelerate near-term delivery of technologies that will meet our militaries requirements to enhance capability and increase interoperability. These include initiatives for advanced trilateral maritime undersea intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and use of each country s autonomous systems to enhance maritime domain awareness. They further noted the role recent exercises have played in demonstrating and testing advanced capabilities, and approved plans to pursue additional demonstrations of several collaborative initiatives including hypersonic and autonomous systems in the 2023-2024 timeframe and beyond. Trilateral capability development will benefit from targeted engagement with defense industry and academic communities within and across our national ecosystems. The three countries intend to intensify engagement with these communities beginning in calendar year 2023. Deeper government, academic, and defense industrial base cooperation on advanced systems will require sustained efforts to continue to improve information and technology sharing. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister reaffirmed their commitment to ongoing work within national systems to enable more robust sharing in these areas. The Secretaries and Deputy Prime Minister committed to continued openness and transparency with international partners on AUKUS. They further emphasized that AUKUS is a strategic partnership focused on enhancing regional stability and safeguarding a free and open Indo-Pacific where conflicts are resolved peacefully and without coercion. They confirmed that AUKUS will complement AUKUS partners engagement with existing regional architecture, including ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum. Indo-Pacific partnerships Australia aukus"

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the Passing of Former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter",
 "text": "I was deeply saddened to learn of the untimely passing of former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. Today, the entire Department of Defense mourns the loss of a towering intellect, a steadfast leader, a devoted mentor to countless public servants, and a great patriot who devoted his life to strengthening the security of the country that he loved. Secretary Carter was a scientist, a scholar, and a strategist. He understood that the United States was, as he put it, the most important provider of security to the world. And he dedicated his long and storied career to fortifying our republic and strengthening what he loved to call the finest fighting force the world has ever known. On his road to becoming the 25th Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter served in many capacities at the Pentagon, from setting policy to managing acquisitions. After the fall of the Soviet Union, he helped to remove nuclear weapons from former Soviet republics. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he made it a high departmental priority to procure cutting-edge military capabilities, such as mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles, to keep our warfighters safe on the battlefield. He served under 11 Secretaries of Defense, under administrations of both parties, before being nominated for the job himself by President Barack Obama. As Secretary, he was a key player in the fight to defeat ISIS. He was a prescient strategic thinker who was early to grasp the growing significance of the Indo-Pacific, the challenges from the People s Republic of China, and the necessity of deeper U.S. investments in the region s security. He also worked tirelessly to strengthen NATO after Russia s aggression against Ukraine in 2014. And he tore down barriers to service when he made the decision to open all U.S. combat positions to women and announced that transgender Americans could openly serve in the U.S. military. A brilliant scholar in his own right, Secretary Carter constantly pushed the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box. He understood early the importance of innovation and technological progress to the overall U.S. defense enterprise. He forged vital new relationships with Silicon Valley, and his legacy continues today in institutions that he started, such as the Defense Innovation Unit and the Strategic Capabilities Office. In his farewell to the men and women of the Department as his tenure came to a close, Secretary Carter reflected that raising one s hand to serve is the noblest thing that a person can do with their life: that is, defend this magnificent country and make a better world for our children.\" After his tenure, he continued to serve, including his service on President Biden s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and the Department s Defense Policy Board. I always deeply valued his wise counsel. And as the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, he returned to his roots as a teacher and helped inspire countless students to pursue their own careers in public service. Secretary Carter was both a defense intellectual and a skillful policymaker who tirelessly sought a more secure America in a more just world. On behalf of the Department of Defense, I send my deepest condolences to his wife Stephanie, his children Ava and Will, and the entire Carter family. Austin Defense Secretary"

 "text": "Today the Department of Defense is releasing the Annual Report on Suicide in the Military for Calendar Year 2021. While I am encouraged to see a decrease in the suicide rate in our Active Component, we recognize we have more work to do. Every death by suicide is a tragedy that impacts our people, our military units, and our readiness. That's why we remain committed to a comprehensive and integrated approach to suicide prevention. Going forward, we are standing up a dedicated prevention workforce to strengthen our efforts to address suicide and other challenging areas. The scale of this workforce is unprecedented and reflects our commitment to make lasting change. Mental health is health period. It's on all of us to end the stigma of asking for help and support when we or someone we know is feeling distressed, anxious, or isolated. Reaching out is a marker of strength and resilience. We will not stop working to address the root causes of this issue. We also continue efforts to improve the quality of life for Service members and their families, address stigma as a barrier to seeking help, and expand our safety efforts for our Service members and their families. While we have made progress in these areas, we must continue to do more. Earlier this year I announced the establishment of the Suicide Prevention and Response Independent Review Committee (SPRIRC), which is working to help prevent suicide in the military by providing an external perspective on our efforts and how we can better support our Service members. I recently spoke with Dr. Gayle Iwamasa, Chair of the SPRIRC, and I look forward to reviewing the committee's concrete, actionable recommendations later this year. We have the most technologically advanced military in the world, but our service members are our most important resource as a fighting force. Mental health wellness and suicide prevention remain critical aspects to our success and the Department's enduring commitment to take care of our people. Service members can reach the crisis line by dialing 988 or 1-800-273-8255 and selecting option 1 after connecting to reach a staffer. In addition, veterans, troops, or their family members can also text 838255 or visit VeteransCrisisLine.net for assistance. Austin Defense Secretary Suicide Prevention prioritizing people"

As we confront strategic competitors and threatening and coercive behavior, the strategy prioritizes the People s Republic of China as our most consequential geopolitical challenge while also standing up to an increasingly aggressive Russia. We will rely on integrated deterrence, as detailed in the Department s National Defense Strategy, which will soon be released in unclassified form. We will seamlessly combine our capabilities to convince potential adversaries that the costs of their hostile activities far outweigh any possible benefits in all theaters, in all domains, and across the spectrum of potential conflict. Meanwhile, we will continue to move boldly to strengthen and modernize our outstanding military, which provides the foundation of deterrence and makes clear our ability to prevail in conflict.

 "text": "On behalf of the Department of Defense, I send my condolences to the family of Her Majesty The Queen and to the people of the United Kingdom and all Commonwealth nations. From an early age, Queen Elizabeth II demonstrated a profound sense of duty to her country and to the world that the next generation would inherit. She grew up in a world rocked by conflict and war, and in a radio address as a young princess, she reminded her generation that, when peace comes, it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place. During World War II, she joined the women s branch of the British Army, making her the first woman of the royal family to be an active duty member of the British Armed Forces. In 1952, Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the throne. She promised to devote her whole life to service and did just that, for the next seven decades. As the United Kingdom s head of state, she was a steady and comforting presence to generations. On the global stage, Queen Elizabeth II was a source of calm and strength over decades of change for country and the world. She helped to fortify the Alliance between our two great democracies, and with her steady leadership, the United Kingdom helped to build and maintain the rules-based international order, rooted in cooperation and democratic values. In 1991, before the Queen addressed a joint session of Congress, President George H.W. Bush said that she had been freedom s friend for as long as we can remember. And on the last day of her long and full life, it feels fitting that countries from around the world are once again rallying together in defense of the rules-based international order that she so ardently supported throughout her decades of service. During this painful moment for the United Kingdom, my thoughts are with the Queen Elizabeth s family, King Charles III, all those who loved her, and with our stalwart British allies.

 "text": "This week, we recognize the end of our military mission in Afghanistan -- one this nation began in the wake of the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, and one in which thousands of America's bravest served with courage and commitment. Proudly, that mission included the service of those who took on the responsibility to help evacuate more than 124,000 Afghans during one of the largest, most difficult and most dangerous humanitarian operations in U.S. military history. No other military could have protected so many lives under such challenging circumstances in such a short amount of time not just because of our airlift or our logistics capabilities, but most of all because of the immense compassion, skill, and dedication of American Service members. As the Department observed last week, 13 courageous Americans gave their lives to defend their teammates and to help save the lives of tens of thousands of innocent Afghan people. Here at home, our military helped settle more than 80,000 Afghans within the United States -- housing, feeding and providing medical care to families seeking a better life. To honor that service, today I am announcing that, at President Biden's direction, all units involved in the retrograde operation from Afghanistan, Operation Allies Refuge and Operation Allies Welcome will be awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation or its equivalent. In addition, I am directing the Military Departments to perform an expedited review of all units present at Hamid Karzai International Airport from August 15 to August 30, 2021, to identify those units or individuals that meet the high standards of the Presidential Unit Citation or appropriate individual awards. Since World War II, the nation has recognized the extraordinary heroism of military units in action against an armed enemy with the Presidential Unit Citation. The President directed these actions after consultation with me and with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. No words can properly honor the deeds we recognize with these awards. What these awards reflect -- and what I hope the units who receive them will feel -- is the gratitude and love of our nation. I hope these awards serve as a reminder to each and every Service member who wears them of the lives they helped save and the thanks of the nation and Department of Defense they serve so well.

 "text": "U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Republic of Korea (ROK) Minister of National Defense Lee Jong-Sup, and Japanese Minister of Defense Kishi Nobuo convened a Trilateral Ministerial Meeting in Singapore on June 11. During the meeting, the three ministers discussed the Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK), enhancing trilateral security cooperation, and addressing common security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. The Ministers pledged that the United States, Japan, and the ROK will cooperate closely toward their shared commitment to achieve the complete denuclearization of, and the establishment of permanent peace on, the Korean Peninsula. Additionally, they affirmed the importance of full implementation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs) by the international community. They underscored the importance of sustained international cooperation to deter, disrupt, and ultimately eliminate the DPRK s illicit ship-to-ship transfers. They recognized the international community s shared goal of the DPRK s full compliance with its international obligations in accordance with all relevant UNSCRs. They also shared their deep concerns about the DPRK s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, which pose a grave threat to international peace and stability, and committed to address these concerns through concerted trilateral cooperation. They further committed to conduct trilateral missile warning and ballistic missile search and tracking exercises, and to identify further trilateral actions in order to address DPRK ballistic missile launches. They strongly condemned the DPRK s repeated unlawful ballistic missile launches and confirmed that any launches of ballistic missiles by the DPRK are a clear violation of multiple UNSCRs. In addition, they shared the recognition that defense-related confidence building among countries in the region is important and committed to strengthening cooperation to institutionalize such efforts. The Ministers discussed other regional security issues and concurred in the importance of deepening trilateral cooperation on key issues to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region, including information sharing, high-level policy consultations, and combined exercises. They expressed strong opposition to any unilateral actions that seek to alter the status quo and increase tensions in the region. They emphasized the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. They shared concerns on activities that are inconsistent with the international rules-based order and stressed the importance of freedom of navigation and overflight. They also reaffirmed that all disputes should be resolved in a peaceful manner in accordance with the principles of international law. The United States reaffirmed its steadfast alliance commitments to Japan and the ROK backed by the full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear. Japan and the ROK highlighted the importance of their bilateral ties and trilateral cooperation to protect and advance their shared security goals. The Ministers committed to work closely together for peace and stability in the region and around the world. Austin Defense Secretary Indo-Pacific"

In this first Memorial Day since the end of America s longest war, we remember the 2,461 U.S. service members and personnel who fell in Afghanistan. We will never forget the sacrifice that they and their families made to this country. When troops enlist, their families serve right alongside them. Their sacrifice and devotion are what makes our armed forces so strong. It is our sacred obligation to support our military families, especially those who have paid the most unthinkable price. Our troops do not just defend our country; they defend the principles of our democracy and our Constitution. Since Russia s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the world has seen again the power of ordinary citizens and soldiers to resist aggression and tyranny, and I hope that the inspiring resilience of the people of Ukraine will remind us all never to take our freedom and democracy for granted. We rededicate ourselves today to the values and principles that our fallen forces gave their lives to defend. So let us remember these patriots with a renewed commitment to making our country worthy of their sacrifice, to keeping their families close to our hearts, and to advancing the democratic ideals for which so many have given so much.

Of course, the United States will continue to coordinate with our Allies and partners to support the needs of the Ukrainian military and people. We also recognize Slovakia for its extraordinary humanitarian assistance efforts and for hosting thousands of Ukrainian refugees. At my direction, and at the invitation of Slovakia, U.S. European Command will reposition one Patriot missile system, manned by U.S. service members, to Slovakia. We expect this battery and its crew to arrive in coming days. Their deployment length has not yet been fixed, as we continue to consult with the Slovak government about more permanent air defense solutions. This deployment of Patriot capabilities to Slovakia aligns perfectly with our previous efforts to bolster NATO s defensive capabilities and to demonstrate our collective security requirements under Article 5 of the NATO treaty. It complements the NATO multinational battlegroup in eastern Slovakia, which includes air defense elements from Germany and the Netherlands. Again, I thank the government of Slovakia for their willingness to assist Ukraine in its long-range air defense needs. This is just another example of the strength of our Alliance, and how President Putin's actions have brought about the very strengthening of NATO that he claimed he was trying to prevent.

 "text": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the President s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget I am proud to join President Biden today in submitting the fiscal year 2023 Budget. Our department s budget will help us continue to defend the nation, take care of our people and succeed through teamwork with our allies and partners. This $773 billion budget request reinforces our commitment to the concept of integrated deterrence, allows us to better sequence and conduct operations around the globe that are aligned to our priorities, modernizes the Joint Force, and delivers meaningful support for our dedicated workforce and their families. To those ends, we are requesting nearly $56.5 billion for air power platforms and systems; more than $40.8 billion for sea power, to include nine more battle force ships, and nearly $12.6 billion to modernize Army and Marine Corps fighting vehicles. We are requesting more than $130.1 billion for research and development in this budget - an all-time high - because we understand the need to sharpen our readiness in advanced technology, cyber, space and artificial intelligence. Importantly, this budget funds modernization of all three legs of the nuclear triad to ensure that we continue to maintain a safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent. And we have devoted more than $3 billion to address the effects of climate change, bolstering our installation resiliency and adaptation to climate challenges. We are also asking that Congress support our efforts to take care of our most critical asset, our people. Our budget requests $479 million to implement the recommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault, and our 4.6 percent pay raise for our military and civilian personnel helps ensure they receive the pay they deserve and need, particular in light of the challenging current economic realities. Our budget request also includes additional investments to provide affordable childcare for both our military and civilian workforce. For instance, we are making additional investments in childcare fee assistance for both military and civilian members. As I have said many times, we need resources matched to strategy, strategy matched to policy and policy matched to the will of the American people. This budget gives us the resources we need to deliver on that promise. Our budget reflects our National Defense Strategy and the focus of that strategy on the pacing challenge of China. It will help us prepare for other future challenges, as well, including those posed by climate change. It preserves our readiness and deterrent posture against the threats we face today: the acute threat of an aggressive Russia and the constantly emerging threats posed by North Korea, Iran, and violent extremist organizations. And it absolutely supports our policy of U.S. global leadership of and responsibility for our vast network of alliances and partnerships.

The two leaders strongly condemned today s missile launch and shared a common understanding that DPRK s missile launches pose a serious threat to the peace and stability of not only the Korean Peninsula and the Indo-Pacific region, but also to the entire world. They also concurred that recent DPRK launches are a clear violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, and demonstrate that DPRK has ended its self-imposed moratorium on ICBM launches, which was made as a promise to the international community. They also agreed that firm responses, including further actions from the UN Security Council, are necessary. Furthermore, the two leaders pledged to continue close consultations between military authorities of the ROK and the U.S. going forward and agreed on the importance of maintaining a robust U.S.-ROK combined defense posture.

 "text": "The Department of Defense stands together in mourning the passing of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She was a titan, a pioneer, and an eloquent and effective champion of American diplomacy and global leadership. I was proud to call her a colleague and a friend. Secretary Albright had a profound respect for the men and women who serve in the U.S. military, and throughout her distinguished career as a scholar and public servant, she understood the credibility and power that the American military puts behind American diplomacy. She admired service members for their eagerness to stand up for freedom, democracy, and American values the causes that she fought for and embodied throughout her historic, path-blazing career. America's first woman Secretary of State famously called the United States the \"indispensable nation,\" and she always understood the importance of American leadership. Secretary Albright was a proud daughter of Central Europe, from a family that fled first the horrors of World War II and then the terrors of Stalinism. It is not lost on me that I learned of her passing while traveling with President Biden to Europe to bolster NATO's Eastern Flank against aggression. Just days before Putin started his war of choice against Ukraine, Secretary Albright wrote of the need to come together to defend \"a world governed by the rule of law,\" rather than \"one answerable to no rules at all.\" Secretary Albright dedicated her life to strengthening a rules-based international system that would uphold human rights, defend democracy, and prevent and halt atrocities against civilians. As U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of State, she reinforced America's alliances, advocated for America's highest ideals, and staunchly supported U.S. military interventions to save innocents from ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo. Last year, I asked Secretary Albright to chair this Department's Defense Policy Board because I wanted unflinching counsel from someone with deep insights into the global moment that we face. In November 2021, Secretary Albright was sworn in as the Board's chair. I was honored and moved by her willingness to serve yet again and grateful for her expertise, humor, and wisdom. Madeleine Albright's lifetime of service will shine bright as an inspiration for all who believe that American values must be central to American statecraft. On behalf of the Department of Defense, I send deepest condolences to Secretary Albright's family and loved ones. Austin Defense Secretary womens history"

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the Closure of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility",
 "text": "After close consultation with senior civilian and military leaders, I have decided to defuel and permanently close the Red Hill bulk fuel storage facility in Hawaii. This is a multi-step process. Throughout the process, we will work closely with the Hawaii Department of Health and with the Environmental Protection Agency to safely defuel the Red Hill facility. No later than May 31, the Secretary of the Navy and Director of the Defense Logistics Agency will provide an action plan for safe and expeditious defueling of the facility, with a completion date target of 12 months. Then, as soon as we have made corrective actions to ensure that defueling will be safe, we will begin defueling. Then we will move to permanently close the Red Hill facility, including conducting any and all necessary environmental remediation around the facility. This is the right thing to do. Centrally-located bulk fuel storage of this magnitude likely made sense in 1943, when Red Hill was built. And Red Hill has served our armed forces well for many decades. But it makes a lot less sense now. The distributed and dynamic nature of our force posture in the Indo-Pacific, the sophisticated threats we face, and the technology available to us demand an equally advanced and resilient fueling capability. To a large degree, we already avail ourselves of dispersed fueling at sea and ashore, permanent and rotational. We will now expand and accelerate that strategic distribution. Moreover, when we use land for military purposes, at home or abroad, we commit to being good stewards of that resource. Closing Red Hill meets that commitment. We will continue our work with the Hawaii Department of Health, national and local elected officials, and other community leaders, to clean up the water at the Red Hill well. And we will develop an environmental mitigation plan to address any future contamination concerns. When we begin to consider land-use options for the property after the fueling facility is closed, we will stay in lockstep with communities in Hawaii. Nothing will be decided without careful and thorough consultation with our partners. The same goes for our workforce and their families. Your health has been impacted, your lives and livelihoods have been disrupted, and in many cases, your very homes have been rendered unavailable to you. We owe you the very best health care we can provide, answers to your many questions, and clean, safe drinking water. Quite frankly, we owe you a return to normal. And you have my commitment to that end. Throughout this process, and moving forward, we have remained grateful for the partnership and guidance of our federal, congressional, state, and community stakeholders. These consultations, which will continue, have both informed and strengthened our planning, and we are deeply appreciative of this support. I set about achieving three priorities when I took this office: defend the nation, take care of our people, and succeed through teamwork. I believe my decision to shut down the Red Hill bulk fuel storage facility aligns with all three of these priorities. The Secretary s memorandum can be found here; the Fact Sheet can be found here.

Al-Qurayshi, also known as Hajii Abdullah, provided near-constant operational guidance to ISIS fighters, to include the prison break and attack at Hasakah and the slaughter of Yazidis in Iraq. He is now off the battlefield and out of command, and cannot threaten any more lives. I also want to praise the leadership of U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command for their superb support to the planning and execution of this dangerous mission.

This operation was specifically designed and conducted in a manner to minimize civilian casualties. We know that al-Qurayshi and others at his compound directly caused the deaths of women and children last night. But, given the complexity of this mission, we will take a look at the possibility our actions may also have resulted in harm to innocent people. The fight against ISIS continues. Their leader may be gone, but their twisted ideology and their intent to kill, maim and terrorize still threaten our national security and the lives of countless innocents. We saw that evil determination in full display during the Hasakah prison break and the fighting that ensued. And so, we will stay at it encouraged by the bravery we witnessed last night and emboldened by the knowledge that ISIS, though still very much a viable threat, is now weaker.

We still have a lot of work to do to achieve that community to banish racism, to fight poverty, to break down barriers, to defend our democracy, and to come together in the common cause of bringing our republic closer to its founding promise. That task belongs to all of us, of course, in or out of uniform. As Dr. King preached, we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, and whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. We understand that mindset very well here in the Department of Defense, as it is the very essence of teamwork. We strive every day to serve this country with honor and integrity, and with a true sense of the contributions that all of us give to the task, no matter where we come from or how we worship. We are a team whose strength derives directly from our diversity. But we understand we cannot take that diversity for granted. We must never stop trying to make sure everyone who serves may do so free of hate, discrimination and fear. The dignity and discipline of Dr. King should stand as an example to us all, then. Let us remember that he, too, led in troubled times. And in our own difficult days, we can draw strength and inspiration from his leadership and his labor. We can, as he did, never stop serving and never stop trying to forge a better future for ourselves and for our children. I thank you all for your service on this and every other day of the year.

 "text": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III I tested positive this morning for COVID-19. I requested the test today after exhibiting symptoms while at home on leave. My symptoms are mild, and I am following my physician s directions. In keeping with those directions, and in accordance with CDC guidelines, I will quarantine myself at home for the next five days. Stemming the spread of this virus, safeguarding our workforce and ensuring my own speedy and safe recovery remain my priorities. To the degree possible, I plan to attend virtually this coming week those key meetings and discussions required to inform my situational awareness and decision making. I will retain all authorities. Deputy Secretary Hicks will represent me as appropriate in other matters. I have informed my leadership team of my positive test result, as well as the President. My staff has begun contact tracing and testing of all those with whom I have come into contact over the last week. My last meeting with President Biden occurred on Tuesday, December 21st, more than a week before I began to experience symptoms. I tested negative that very morning. I have not been in the Pentagon since Thursday, where I met briefly - and only - with a few members of my staff. We were properly masked and socially distanced throughout. As my doctor made clear to me, my fully vaccinated status and the booster I received in early October have rendered the infection much more mild than it would otherwise have been. And I am grateful for that. The vaccines work and will remain a military medical requirement for our workforce. I continue to encourage everyone eligible for a booster shot to get one. This remains a readiness issue. Austin Defense Secretary coronavirus Biden president covid19vaccine Hicks Deputy Defense Secretary"

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on Water Contamination Issues on Oahu",
 "text": "Nothing is more important to me or to this Department than the health, safety and well-being of our people and their families, as well as that of residents living near our installations. To that end, I am receiving daily updates by the Navy Department about fresh water contamination near the strategically important Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam contamination that has directly affected thousands of military members and their families. More than three thousand have been displaced from their military housing and are living temporarily in hotels, and thousands have been evaluated by medical staff. We take this very seriously. And I am personally monitoring our progress and our mitigation efforts. Indeed, Navy leadership updates me daily on the measures they are taking to care for affected military personnel and families, to restore the safety of the water system in military housing, and to coordinate with local authorities in particular the Hawaii State Department of Health about the best way forward. They have also provided me an update on the status of the Navy's investigation into the causes of this contamination and its plan to supplement environmental health measures on the island with additional resources and experts. I fully support the Navy's decision to suspend operations at the Red Hill Underground Storage Tanks while investigative efforts continue and their commitment to conduct an independent study of operations and system integrity at Red Hill. My expectation is that military leaders in Hawaii will continue to do everything they can as fast as they can to return residents safely back to their homes and to communicate clearly and frequently the steps they are taking to do so. I appreciate the value of their efforts to date: providing temporary lodging, establishing a Pregnancy Medical Advice Hotline, delivering more than 150,000 gallons of potable water, and flying in additional water filtration systems to the island. I also expect them to continue to keep the people of Hawaii, legislators and leaders fully informed. Adm. Paparo, the Pacific Fleet Commander, is now the on-scene commander and understands those expectations.* But in that same spirit, I have asked Deputy Secretary Hicks to visit the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility this week during her travel to Hawaii and to consult with Navy leaders, local officials, experts, and affected personnel and families. As I said, nothing is more important than the health and well-being of our people and our neighbors. We will solve this problem, and we will do so safely, expeditiously and transparently. * Edited December 14 to reflect correct usage. Defense Secretary Austin"

We also honor the sacrifice of those who did not survive the attack, who died in defense of their country. The ranks of Pearl Harbor survivors grow thinner with each passing year. But the memory of their heroism and our gratitude still shine bright. They were among the first of the Greatest Generation to taste combat, to know war. And they answered that call to duty with exceptional skill and fortitude. We still stand on their broad shoulders. Indeed, now together with our allies and partners, we remain committed to defending the free and open Indo-Pacific that these heroes built. And we remain committed to maintaining the international rules-based order that they forged, one that raised billions of people out of poverty and made the world a more prosperous place -- not just for one nation's people, but for people across the globe. Old enemies are now the closest of friends. Old Soldiers and Sailors are now the best of teachers and sterling examples. And old battlefields -- like Pearl Harbor -- now inspire us to preserve the peace and stability for which so many sacrificed. We remember today, to be sure, and we are humbled.

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the Impact of a Full-Year Continuing Resolution",
 "text": "The Department of Defense once again faces the threat of a continuing resolution to fund our programs and operations into the new year. While the short-term CR passed by Congress was a necessary measure to keep the government open and provide additional time to reach agreement on full-year appropriations bills, some have even suggested a CR could last an entire year, an unprecedented move that would cause enormous, if not irreparable, damage for a wide range of bipartisan priorities from defense readiness and modernization, to research and development, to public health. A full-year CR would be a fiscally unsound way of funding the Department of Defense and government as a whole. It would misalign billions of dollars in resources in a manner inconsistent with evolving threats and the national security landscape, which would erode the U.S. military advantage relative to China, impede our ability to innovate and modernize, degrade readiness, and hurt our people and their families. And it would offer comfort to our enemies, disquiet to our allies, and unnecessary stress to our workforce. Essentially, in terms of real dollars, a CR would represent a budget cut and a significant one at that. I urge Congress to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on FY 2022 appropriations, and avoid a full-year CR, in the coming weeks. First and most importantly, failure to reach an agreement would put our military and their families under additional and needless stress. It would mean that providing the 2.7 percent pay increase the President proposed and they so richly deserve -- as well as housing allowances and other new benefits -- would come at the expense of suspending many of their change-of-station moves and force us to limit the numbers of new recruits we bring in. And it would result in over five billion dollars in cuts to our operating accounts, too, hurting the readiness of our troops and curtailing our ability to cover the health-care needs of military families. More than 100 military construction projects -- many of which directly impact the quality of life of our people -- would also be delayed if Congress maintains current funding levels under a full-year CR. And make no mistake about it, the impacts of those delays would be felt not only across the Department, but also in local communities around the country as job opportunities are lost and revenue for local businesses diminishes. Of course, failing to reach an agreement on appropriations would also significantly impact the programs, the technologies and the initiatives we are trying to undertake to ensure we remain the most capable military in the world. The Department's efforts to address innovation priorities such as cyber, artificial intelligence and hypersonics programs would be slowed. At a time when our adversaries are advancing their concepts and capabilities to erode our strategic advantages and as we begin to knit together a truly groundbreaking vision of integrated deterrence our hands will be tied. We will be forced to spend money on things we don't need and stop spending money on investments we desperately do need. And I'd note that as important as full-year appropriations are for the Department of Defense, investments at the State Department, in research and development at the major research agencies, and in infrastructure and public health are equally critical to our national security. Again, I strongly urge Congress to seize this opportunity to sustain American competitiveness, advance American leadership, and enable our forces by immediately reaching a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on full-year 2022 appropriations. It's not only the right thing to do, it's the best thing they can do for our nation's defense. Austin Defense Secretary budget"

 "text": "On behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense -- those currently serving -- I want to take this opportunity to thank all those who have come before us. Veterans Day is a unique opportunity for us to reflect upon the service and sacrifice of our predecessors, to recognize the broad shoulders upon which we now stand. In peace and in war, spanning generations all the way back to the very founding of this country, fellow Americans have defended our democracy, advanced our security interests, fought our wars and preserved our way of life. Some never returned to society the same as when they left home for boot camp. Some never returned at all. But all of them, living and dead, are owed a great debt. And all of them as well as their families are due our deepest respect. That s why we in the Department of Defense continue to partner with the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure the transition to civilian life is as seamless as possible for everyone serving today. And it s why we are working so hard to provide the best medical and mental health care possible for those whose military service has concluded. We must prove capable of treating the wounds we see, as well as the ones we cannot see. We must also ensure, as a nation, that the growth, development and opportunities for veterans persist well after they take off the uniform. From education to employment opportunities, we in the Department will continue to make sure our transitioning members understand fully and can secure the benefits available to them and to their families. And we thank those families as well, for they served our country every bit as our veterans did. Through frequent moves and deployments and the stress and strain of everyday military life, they made possible what our troops made possible for national defense. Finally, we should remember that many veterans still serve this country. From community volunteering to leadership at the highest levels in both the private and public sectors, veterans make an enormous difference. They run companies. They run non-profits. They run for office. They still lead and inform and motivate others to succeed and to serve. On this Veterans Day, I hope that lesson in particular is one not lost on anyone. And I take comfort in knowing that in communities large and small across this land, the American people continue to find ways to reach out and support our veterans who they know as their neighbors and teachers and coaches and friends. So, to our predecessors -- our veterans and your brave families -- thank you for the service you rendered in uniform and for that service you still render our great country. We honor you today, and we remember you always. Veterans Day Austin Defense Secretary Observances"

 "text": "The Department of Defense stands united in mourning the loss of Senator Max Cleland, an extraordinary public servant and a great patriot. Max Cleland joined the U.S. Army in 1965 following in the tradition of his father, who served in World War II and volunteered to fight in Vietnam. In April 1968, amid the fury of Khe Sanh, a live hand grenade was dropped on the ground, and its blast cost him both of his legs and his right arm. He served his country and his community from a wheelchair, following in the gallant tradition of his hero President Franklin Roosevelt. Senator Cleland wrote that he \"found solace in attempting to turn my pain into somebody else's gain' by immersing myself in politics and public service.\" After serving in statewide office in his beloved state of Georgia and working as a staffer for the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, he was named the head of the Veterans Administration, where he fought fiercely for his fellow veterans, made PTSD an official VA diagnosis, and helped create the groundbreaking Vet Centers program. Later, after being elected a U.S. senator from Georgia, he continued his passionate focus on defense and veterans' issues, serving with distinction on the Senate Armed Services Committee and leading on such issues as health care, bioterrorism preparedness, and homeland security. He also served on the 9/11 Commission before being nominated for the board of the Export-Import Bank. His final act of public service was leading the American Battlefield Monuments Commission. When battle maps of Vietnam were added to the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, he asked to add an inscription from the poet Archibald MacLeish: \"We leave you our deaths: give them their meaning.\" With courage and grit, Senator Cleland struggled with PTSD and depression seeking help through counseling, medication, and attendance at a recovery group. He said that he drew strength from being around his fellow veterans and wounded warriors, including those from Iraq and Afghanistan. As the head of the VA, he made psychological counseling available to his fellow veterans. And I hope that his example will encourage others carrying unseen wounds to seek out the help they need and deserve. Senator Cleland liked to quote Hemingway, who wrote, \"The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.\" He surely was. Max Cleland's civic-minded spirit, optimism, and resilience will stand as an inspiration to every American. Veterans Austin Defense Secretary Vietnam War"

I remember my own days in uniform, and I can t begin to imagine how much more difficult my Army career would have been were it not for my spouse, Charlene, and my incredible family. The frequent moves, the multiple deployments, the strain and the stress over the last twenty years of war -- my family and all of yours have borne it with grace and resilience. But it goes beyond that, of course. They don t just bear the hardships; our families make us a stronger force, a healthier force. They make sacrifices themselves, to be sure, but they also make possible the sacrifices our men and women sustain. Put simply, our families make us more ready every day for the task of defending this nation. And they do the very same for our veterans, from helping with the transition to civilian life to care-giving and emotional support. They are there for us, and so we must be there for them. Arm-in-arm with our colleagues at the Department of Veterans Affairs, we will continue to meet the challenges our military families face: mental health and well-being, childcare and schooling, food and economic security, and spouse employment, to name but a few. And we know that the COVID-19 pandemic has only made these challenges, and many others, more difficult. We have much work to do. And I want each and every military family to know we will stay committed to that work, the same way they have stayed committed to their loved ones and to this nation they help defend. As I said, our families serve every bit as much as we do. The month of November provides us a terrific opportunity to say thank you for that, but we need to treat the effort of improving their lives as the critical task it must be. To all our veteran and military families thank you! We honor your sacrifice. We recognize your resilience. We hold dear to our hearts your ceaseless love and support. We owe that and so much more.

As the Department of Defense Climate Risk Analysis makes clear, climate change is altering the strategic landscape and shaping the security environment, posing complex threats to the United States and nations around the world. Exacerbated by climate change, extreme weather events are increasingly damaging infrastructure, disrupting supply chains, impacting force readiness and operations, and contributing to humanitarian crises and instability across the globe.

The Department of Defense Climate Risk Analysis lays out a path to incorporate these security considerations into our activities at a strategic level, so we can prevent, mitigate, and respond to this common threat.

He led a great American life, and his love of country shone throughout his long and distinguished career in the military and in other forms of public service. From his earliest days in the U.S. Army, it was clear that Colin Powell was an exceptional leader. Serving two tours in Vietnam, he earned the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Soldier s Medal for heroism, among other military decorations. He culminated his time in uniform as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he oversaw Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm with his singular brand of sure and steady professionalism and courage. In and out of uniform, he earned the trust of U.S. presidents, foreign leaders, diplomats, and the American people. As Secretary of State, Colin Powell advanced U.S. values of democracy, diversity, and freedom all around the world. And through his philanthropic work, this son of immigrants raised in the South Bronx set out to expand opportunity for young people, helping them find something they do well and love doing, just as he had found in the U.S. military. While we mourn his loss, we also honor the profound imprint that Colin Powell has left on the United States. Generations of young leaders will continue to look to his example and his character as the foundation for their own success. It is difficult to overstate the difference he made. I counted him among my best mentors and friends, and this news has left a hole in my heart. There will never be another Colin Powell. He made history. He made the country he loved a safer, better place. And we will forever be grateful for his leadership. Our thoughts remain with his beloved Alma, his children Michael, Linda, and Annemarie, and the rest of his family at this sad and painful time. Austin Defense Secretary"

He has been my mentor for a number of years. He always made time for me and I could always go to him with tough issues. He always had great counsel. We will certainly miss him. I feel as if I have a hole in my heart, just learning of this recently. He was the first African-American chairman of the Joint Chiefs, first African-American Secretary of State and a man who was respected around the globe.

Since then, the U.S. Treasury has been taking extraordinary measures to prevent the United States from defaulting on its obligations. If the United States defaults, it would undermine the economic strength on which our national security rests. It would also seriously harm our service members and their families because, as Secretary, I would have no authority or ability to ensure that our service members, civilians, or contractors would be paid in full or on time. Here are some other potential impacts: The benefits earned by and owed to 2.4 million military retirees and 400,000 survivors would also be at risk. Federal contractors, including large firms and thousands of small businesses, that provide our military with world-class services, technology, and equipment could have their payments delayed, jeopardizing their operations and many American jobs. A default risks undermining the international reputation of the United States as a reliable and trustworthy economic and national security partner. A default also risks undermining the stature of the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency of choice. Our service members and Department of Defense civilians live up to their commitments.

I feel these losses personally and mourn alongside the families and loved ones of those we have lost. Each suicide sends forth wave after wave of pain and grief. One such tragedy is too many. Today, the Department of Defense has released our Annual Suicide Report for Calendar Year 2020. The findings are troubling. Suicide rates among our service members and military families are still too high, and the trends are not going in the right direction. This is a paramount challenge for our Department.

We will continue to work swiftly and urgently, in close collaboration with our partners at the Department of Veterans Affairs. I know that these are difficult days for many people in our Department of Defense workforce, for our military communities, and for my fellow veterans. If you find yourself contemplating suicide or simply feel that you could use a helping hand, please immediately seek support from a mental-health professional, reach out to your family, friends, a clergy member, or talk to a trained professional at the Veterans and Military Crisis Line or Military OneSource. As I have said, mental health is health period. We must all do more, at every level, to end the stigma against getting help. We all need counsel, community, and connection.

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the Results of Central Command Investigation Into the 29 August Airstrike",
 "text": "General McKenzie briefed me this morning about the findings of his investigation into the 29 August Kabul airstrike. The investigation concluded that the strike -- conducted to prevent what was believed to be an imminent threat to Hamid Karzai International Airport -- resulted in the deaths of as many as 10 people, including up to seven children. On behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, I offer my deepest condolences to surviving family members of those who were killed, including Mr. Ahmadi, and to the staff of Nutrition and Education International, Mr. Ahmadi s employer. We now know that there was no connection between Mr. Ahmadi and ISIS-Khorasan, that his activities on that day were completely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced, and that Mr. Ahmadi was just as innocent a victim as were the others tragically killed. We apologize, and we will endeavor to learn from this horrible mistake. To that end, I have directed a thorough review of the investigation just completed by U.S. Central Command. I have asked for this review to consider the degree to which the investigation considered all available context and information, the degree to which accountability measures need be taken and at what level, and the degree to which strike authorities, procedures and processes need to be altered in the future. No military works harder than ours to avoid civilian casualties. When we have reason to believe we have taken innocent life, we investigate it and, if true, we admit it. But we also must work just as hard to prevent recurrence -- no matter the circumstances, the intelligence stream or the operational pressures under which we labor. We will do that in this case. We will scrutinize not only what we decided to do -- and not do -- on the 29th of August, but also how we investigated those outcomes. We owe that to the victims and their loved ones, to the American people and to ourselves. Austin Defense Secretary Afghanistan Central Command"

Seventy years ago, we formally established the Unbreakable Alliance that continues to provide stability and security for the Indo-Pacific and beyond. While the Alliance itself is 70 years old, Australia and the United States have fought side by side in every major conflict since World War I. The United States will never forget that twenty years ago, on September 11, Australia invoked, for the first time in its history, the collective defense article of the ANZUS Treaty. Once again, Australia sent troops to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States and other allies and partners through nearly 20 years of combat. It is a testament to the enduring nature of Mateship. Our Australian allies stood by with us to the very end of our presence in Afghanistan and the United States will be forever grateful. As we celebrate the signing of the ANZUS Treaty and the U.S. - Australian Alliance, we are also setting our sights on the future. Our shared interests and values ensure that our Alliance will continue to advance our shared vision for a Free and Open Indo-Pacific. In a few short days, I look forward to hosting Australian Minister for Defence Dutton at the Pentagon, followed by this year s Australia - United States Ministerial (AUSMIN) consultations here in Washington, D.C.

 "text": "Today, we completed the U.S. military evacuation of civilians and the removal of all U.S. forces from Afghanistan. I am deeply saddened that, in the course of this historic evacuation mission, we lost 13 of our own, along with so many others who were killed and wounded days ago by cruel terrorists. We mourn alongside the families of those who were lost, and we will never forget your loved ones heroism and sacrifice. They gave their lives trying to save the lives of others. And I know that you share my pride in them. I hope that all Americans also share my pride in all the troops and diplomats who raced to help save lives during those critical days of August. Our service members secured, defended, and ran a major international airport. They learned how to help consular officers screen and verify visa applicants. They provided medical care, food and water, and compassion to people in need. They flew tens of thousands of people to safety, virtually around the clock. They even delivered babies. No other military in the world could accomplish what we and our allies and partners did in such a short span of time. That is a testament not only to our forces capabilities and courage but also to our relationships and the capabilities of our allies and partners. Over the course of more than four decades in service, I have never ceased to be amazed at what an American service member can do. I remain in awe. And I am thankful for the skill and professionalism with which they do it. I want to thank all those who labored so hard and under such difficult circumstances over the past few weeks, including dozens of our diplomats, to move some 6,000 of our fellow citizens out of harm s way and evacuate more than 123,000 people from Afghanistan the vast majority of whom are Afghans, friends and allies who fought by our side and fought for our shared values. We will help these Afghan friends as they now turn to the task of beginning new lives in new places. We will provide these men, women, and children with temporary living spaces, medical care, and sustenance at military facilities at home and abroad. We will continue to support the interagency effort led by the Department of Homeland Security to screen them and to process some of them to lead new lives in America. And we will work hard to defend our citizens from terrorist threats emanating from anywhere around the globe. Now, the end of this operation also signals the end of America s longest war. We lost 2,461 troops in that war, and tens of thousands of others suffered wounds, seen and unseen. The scars of combat don t heal easily, and often never heal at all. As we look back as a nation on two decades of combat and struggle in Afghanistan, I hope that we will do so with as much thoughtfulness and humility as we can muster. And I know that we will wish for a brighter future for the Afghan people for all their sons, and for all their daughters. Amid these discussions, we must remember our Gold Star families, and the support that we owe them. We must remember the wounded and the family members and the caregivers who still tend to them. We must remember the veterans of this war, those still on duty and those who have hung up the uniform. This country owes them all a profound debt of gratitude. And we must remember the citizens whom we serve and the nation that we defend. For my part, I am proud of the part that we played in this war. I am proud of the men and women who led me. I am proud of those with whom I served and led. And I am proud of the intrepid, resilient families who made what we did possible. Lloyd J.

He leaves a lasting legacy of rigorous oversight over defense programs and a deep commitment to cooperative threat reduction. His close partnership with his Republican counterpart, the late Senator John Warner, demonstrated to the whole country the degree to which he believed national security was not and should not be a political issue. Throughout it all, his North Star remained the same: vigorous support for our national defense, accountability to the American people, and tireless advocacy on behalf of our men and women in uniform, as well as their families.

Austin III and Singapore Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen met at the Ministry of Defence during Secretary Austin s introductory visit to Singapore. Secretary Austin and Dr Ng reaffirmed both countries long-standing and multi-faceted bilateral defense relationship, which was most recently underscored by the signing of the 2019 Protocol of Amendment renewing the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding(MOU) Regarding United States Use of Facilities in Singapore and the signing of the MOU concerning the establishment of a Republic of Singapore Air Force Fighter Training Detachment in Guam. Secretary Austin thanked Singapore for the logistical support that it provides to U.S. military aircraft and vessels, as well as for facilitating the regular rotational deployment of U.S. Littoral Combat Ships and P-8 Poseidon aircraft. This support is anchored on the shared belief that the United States presence in the region is vital for its peace, prosperity, and stability. Secretary Austin and Dr Ng committed to continue discussions on U.S. force posture initiatives. Secretary Austin and Dr Ng emphasized the strong U.S.-Singapore bilateral training relationship. This was demonstrated by both countries Armed Forces training together at recent bilateral exercises such as the 3rdExercise Pacific Griffin and the 40th Exercise Tiger Balm, multilateral exercises such as Exercise Rim of the Pacific and Exercise Red Flag Nellis, and multiple professional and policy exchanges and interactions. They look forward to the continued resumption of physical interactions between the two defense establishments. Secretary Austin emphasized that the Department of Defense values Singapore s training presence inside the United States. Dr Ng and Secretary Austin noted that they look forward to new high-end bilateral training opportunities, including future cooperation as the United States hosts Singapore s future F-35B fighter aircraft detachment. Dr Ng thanked Secretary Austin for the United States strong support in facilitating Singapore s overseas training and exercises, which helps overcome its space constraints. Secretary Austin and Dr Ng commended new and growing areas of cooperation in the bilateral partnership. These include Singapore s establishment of the multilateral Counter-Terrorism Information Facility, for which the United States is a partner nation. Singapore was also pleased to join the multi-national Artificial Intelligence Partnership for Defense in May 2021, which aims to enable multilateral cooperation and exchange of best practices on responsible AI in the defense sector. Secretary Austin and Dr Ng expressed hope for further cooperation, including in areas such as cyber defense, strategic communications and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief. Secretary Austin and Dr Ng discussed the regional security environment and agreed on the importance of sustaining a rules-based order. They also agreed to continue finding ways to expand the role of the U.S.-Singapore partnership in maintaining regional stability, such as through increased exchanges and training opportunities for the region's young defense leaders.

 "text": "I was pleased this morning to welcome home Gen. Scott Miller and his staff. On Monday, Gen. Miller concluded his nearly three-year tour as Commander of United States Forces-Afghanistan, and turned those responsibilities over to Gen. Frank McKenzie. As Gen. McKenzie noted during the turnover ceremony, Scott Miller was the right leader at the right time. Not only did he plan and lead the complex withdrawal of millions of tons of equipment and thousands of personnel, his team did so with the understanding that speed was of the essence. Speed is safety. And it largely for this reason that this truly historic feat has thus far been conducted without a single casualty. Equally important are the tireless efforts Gen. Miller has undertaken these last three years to secure our hard-fought interests in Afghanistan, as well as those of our NATO Allies, Coalition partners, and Afghan partners. His exceptional operational acumen and strategic vision has helped ensure that America will not be threatened by terrorist networks emanating from within Afghanistan. Scott and his staff are home now, and we are grateful for their safe return. But our mission in Afghanistan is not over. The drawdown continues and will be complete by the end of August. DOD remains committed to protecting our diplomatic presence in country, continuing to provide funding to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and advising to Afghan security ministries, and preventing the re-emergence of violent extremist organizations. We will also be working closely with the State Department to help re-locate those Afghans and their families who have been of such service to our mission. We take seriously our obligation to them, and we honor their contributions. As we have over the last 20 years, so must we continue to honor the service and sacrifice of those who have performed so bravely in the field. They and their families have struggled and sacrificed on our behalf. In many ways they still do. But they also have much for which to be proud. That we have not been attacked from Afghanistan since 9-11, that the Afghan government now has the opportunity to advance the progress which has been made in their country, and that the Afghan forces now have in their possession the capabilities the advantages they need to defend their people all stands as testament to the skill, professionalism and courage of our troops and those of our allies.

 "text": "Yesterday, I received the final recommendations and complete report of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment. I want to thank Lynn Rosenthal for her exceptional leadership of this commission, as well as the talented experts who worked so diligently to support her. The work they produced was informed not only by their own significant experience, but by that of so many members of our military, including sexual assault survivors. The result is a comprehensive assessment across four lines of effort -- accountability, prevention, climate and culture, and victim care and support -- that recommends creative and evidence-based options. It provides us real opportunities to finally end the scourge of sexual assault and sexual harassment in the military. In coming days, I will present to President Biden my specific recommendations about the commission s findings, but I know enough at this point to state the following: First, we will work with Congress to amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice, removing the prosecution of sexual assaults and related crimes from the military chain of command. The IRC recommended the inclusion of other special victims crimes inside this independent prosecution system, to include domestic violence. I support this as well, given the strong correlation between these sorts of crimes and the prevalence of sexual assault. Second, solving this problem requires not just greater accountability, which we need, but also changes to our approach on prevention, command climate, and victim services. I am reviewing the full scope of the commission s recommendations in these areas, but generally they appear strong and well-grounded. I have directed my staff to do a detailed assessment and implementation plan for my review and approval. Third, the Department will need new resources and authorities necessary to implement the IRC s recommendations. Those we believe we can implement under existing authorities will be given priority. We will need to work closely with Congress to secure additional authorities and relief where needed. We will most assuredly require additional resources, both in personnel and in funding. But it may take us some time to determine how much and where they are most wisely applied. Finally, as in all other things, these changes demand leadership. I appreciate the support that the Department s civilian and military leaders have provided to the commission, and the thoughtfulness with which they have advised me as we develop effective ways to implement the changes we need to eliminate sexual assault and sexual harassment from our ranks. As I made clear on my first full day in office, this is a leadership issue. And we will lead. Our people depend upon it. They deserve nothing less.

They also improve our warfighting capability, support family-sustaining jobs, and strengthen our alliances and partnerships. Though there is more work to be done, the Department of Defense remains committed to a whole-of-government approach to preserve our access to strategic and critical materials. This is important not only for our national defense, but to ensure our national economic well-being. The department defines strategic and critical minerals as those that support military and essential civilian industry; and are not found or produced in the United States in quantities to meet our needs. Like many other supply chains, much of the strategic and critical materials sector has moved offshore. Some of this reflects normal, comparative advantage or quirks of geologic fate. But, in some cases, other countries have deliberately put a hand on the scale to capture market-share, and our industry has followed close behind in a global race to the bottom. The concentration of global supply chains for strategic and critical materials in China creates risk of disruption and of politicized trade practices, including the use of forced labor. Though DoD has requirements for strategic and critical materials, the civilian economy would bear the brunt of the harm from a supply disruption event. Overall, the recommendations presented by DoD are intended to attack the supply and demand side of the strategic and critical materials question at the same time. The full report can be found here.

In 1972, the future senator went on to serve as Secretary of the Navy, where, among other achievements, he signed the Incidents at Sea agreement with the Soviet Union. At the height of the Cold War, this bilateral pact helped keep our country safe by reducing the chances of unwitting escalation. He drew on his defense experience and expertise in the Senate, where he represented Virginia for five terms. As chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he became known for independence and for building bipartisan partnerships, earning the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. He pushed hard for legislation banning the torture of alleged terrorists, and he opposed the don t ask, don t tell policy. Throughout his long public career, Senator Warner stood up for our men and women in uniform and made lasting contributions to our national security. Charlene and I send our deepest condolences to the Warner family. Senator Warner will be missed, but his legacy of service will continue to inspire the next generation of leaders to serve our great nation. Austin Defense Secretary"

 "text": "I want to take this opportunity to thank the Soldiers and Airmen of the National Guard who for the last five months have been standing watch over the Capitol grounds in Washington, D.C. They came here from all 54 states and territories, leaving behind jobs, homes and families, to bolster security at the Capitol in the wake of the dramatic events on January 6th. Many of them volunteered for this duty, and most of them did so on little notice. In good weather and bad -- sometimes cold and wet and tired -- they provided critical capability to the Capitol Police and local authorities. These airmen and soldiers protected not only the grounds, but the lawmakers working on those grounds, ensuring the people s business could continue unabated. They lived out in very tangible ways the oath they took to support and defend the Constitution. It s been a trying but telling year for the National Guard. Between natural disasters, civil unrest and an ongoing pandemic, our Guardsmen and women have been tested time and time again. And each time, they have performed magnificently. So magnificently, in fact, that it would be all too easy to take their service -- and that of their incredible families -- for granted. We won t do that, of course, because we know we will continue to call on them in times of need. As these troops depart for home and a much-deserved reunion with loved ones, I hope they do so knowing how much the nation appreciates their service and sacrifice -- and that of their families and employers. I hope they know how very proud we are of them. Austin Defense Secretary national guard"

 "text": "Republic of Korea (ROK) Minister of Foreign Affairs Chung Eui-yong and Minister of National Defense Suh Wook hosted a Joint Foreign and Defense Ministerial meeting with United States (U.S.) Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III in Seoul on March 18, 2021. The Ministers and Secretaries reaffirmed that the ROK-U.S. Alliance, forged in blood on the battlefield 70 years ago, serves as the linchpin of peace, security, and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and the Indo-Pacific region. Amid increasing global threats, the Alliance has never been more important. They also acknowledged that the ROK-U.S. Alliance has developed into a comprehensive global partnership grounded in mutual respect and trust, close friendship, strong people-to-people ties, and shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. They vowed to further promote mutually-reinforcing and future-oriented cooperation across a wide range of areas encompassing a robust trade relationship, cooperation on combatting the climate crisis, and coordination on pandemic relief and post-COVID-19 economic recovery. Both sides reaffirmed a mutual commitment to the defense of the ROK and to the strengthening of the ROK-U.S. combined defense posture, consistent with the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty. U.S. officials reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the defense of the ROK and its extended deterrence using the full range of U.S. capabilities. Both sides committed to strengthening the Alliance deterrence posture, and they reiterated the importance of maintaining joint readiness against all shared threats to the Alliance through combined training and exercises. Both Secretaries and Ministers noted that U.S. forces in the ROK continue to play a critical role in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region, and committed to continuing to ensure that we have the force posture and capabilities necessary to meet our common challenges. Both sides affirmed that the agreement in principle on a new multi-year Special Measures Agreement is a symbol of the shared commitment to the ROK-U.S. Alliance, supports the stable presence of U.S. forces stationed in Korea, and enhances our combined defense posture. The Ministers and Secretaries noted that since both sides decided to pursue the transition of wartime Operational Control (OPCON) in 2006, the ROK and the United States have achieved great progress through their combined efforts and reiterated their firm commitment to wartime OPCON transition consistent with the Conditions-Based OPCON Transition Plan (COT-P). Building on this progress, the leaders pledged to continue efforts toward the transition. The Ministers and Secretaries emphasized that North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile issues are a priority for the Alliance, and reaffirmed a shared commitment to address and resolve these issues. They affirmed the importance of full implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions by the international community, including North Korea. The ROK and the United States are closely coordinating on all issues related to the Korean Peninsula. Both sides shared the view that these issues should be addressed through a fully-coordinated common strategy toward North Korea between the ROK and the United States. To this end, they committed to maintain high-level consultations on the United States ongoing North Korea policy review. The Ministers and Secretaries affirmed the importance of ROK-U.S.-Japan trilateral cooperation and pledged to continue promoting mutually-beneficial, forward looking cooperation to promote peace, security, and prosperity in the region. Against the backdrop of increasing challenges to the regional security environment, the shared values of the ROK-U.S. Alliance undergird the two countries commitment to opposing all activities that undermine and destabilize the rules-based international order. The ROK and the United States emphasized that they remain united in their shared commitment to maintaining peace and stability, unimpeded lawful commerce, and respect for international law. The ROK and the United States reiterated their resolve to continue to work together to create a free and open Indo-Pacific region through cooperation with the ROK s New Southern Policy. The two countries are united in their dedication to support ASEAN centrality and other regional efforts. Both sides acknowledged the contributions of ongoing bilateral dialogues to expanding regional coordination with the Pacific Island countries and in the Mekong sub-region. The Ministers and Secretaries emphasized the role that the ROK and the United States have played in nurturing partnership and cooperation in our collective response to an increasing number of global challenges. They committed to deepening cooperation across a range of areas including trade, health, non-proliferation, nuclear energy, COVID-19, combatting the climate crisis, space, and cybersecurity. The Ministers and Secretaries emphasized that the ROK-U.S. Alliance built upon shared values and bonded by trust is stronger than ever. In this era of challenges and opportunities, the Ministers and Secretaries noted the dynamism, reciprocity, and boundless potential of the Alliance and reiterated their commitment to further advancing and deepening ROK-U.S. cooperation.

 "title": "Statement by Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III on the Initiation of a Global Force Posture Review",
 "text": "President Biden s call today for American leadership on the world stage, and in particular his belief that diplomacy should be our first tool of choice, is reassuring not only to the men and women of the Department of Defense, but to our fellow citizens as well. It means the United States, never afraid to fight when we must, will also never be afraid to engage in difficult discussions and negotiations. Of course, it also means that we in the Department must be ever-ready to buttress the hard work of diplomacy, to support it with the capabilities our nation needs to make clear our determination and to secure our interests when challenged. If we must fight, we must win. That requires a laser-focus on talent and training, innovation and leadership, forward presence and readiness. At the direction of the President, the Department will therefore conduct a global force posture review of U.S. military footprint, resources, strategy and missions. It will inform my advice to the Commander-in-Chief about how we best allocate military forces in pursuit of national interests. The review will be led by the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, in close consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We will consult our allies and partners as we conduct this review. As I said on my first day in the job, no one succeeds at this business alone. From Afghanistan and the Middle East, across Europe, Africa and our own hemisphere, to the wide expanse of the Western Pacific, the United States stands shoulder-to-shoulder with allies old and new, partners big and small. Each of them brings to the mission unique skills, knowledge and capabilities. And each of them represents a relationship worth tending, preserving and respecting. We will do so. As President Kennedy once observed, diplomacy and defense are not mutually-exclusive. They complement one another. They each make the other stronger. And each alone will likely fail. Today, President Biden reminds us that risk of such failure is still high, and that the costs of American leadership -- also high -- are still worth paying. He reminds us that the American people are safer when we act in concert with our allies and in accordance with our values. And he challenges us to remember that, while force may be the final, diplomacy must be the first arbiter of our peace and security. Austin Defense Secretary"

 "text": "I fully support the President s direction today to include climate considerations as an essential element of our national security and to assess the impacts of climate change on our security strategies, operations, and infrastructure. Since 2010, the Department of Defense has acknowledged that the planet s changing climate has a dramatic effect on our missions, plans, and installations. Every year, we see the consequences of increasing incidents of flooding, drought, wildfires, and extreme weather events on our installations at home. Every year, our commanders and their Allies and partners conduct operations that result from instability in societies strained by desertification, the threat of adversary access to homelands through the Arctic, and the demands for humanitarian assistance worldwide. In 2019 alone, the Department assessed climate-related impacts to 79 installations and in every geographic Combatant Command area of responsibility. We know first-hand the risk that climate change poses to national security because it affects the work we do every day. The Department will immediately take appropriate policy actions to prioritize climate change considerations in our activities and risk assessments, to mitigate this driver of insecurity. As directed by the President, we will include the security implications of climate change in our risk analyses, strategy development, and planning guidance. As a leader in the interagency, the Department of Defense will also support incorporating climate risk analysis into modeling, simulation, wargaming, analysis, and the next National Defense Strategy. And by changing how we approach our own carbon footprint, the Department can also be a platform for positive change, spurring the development of climate-friendly technologies at scale. There is little about what the Department does to defend the American people that is not affected by climate change. It is a national security issue, and we must treat it as such.

The Department will immediately take appropriate policy action to ensure individuals who identify as transgender are eligible to enter and serve in their self-identified gender. These changes will ensure no one will be separated or discharged, or denied reenlistment, solely on the basis of gender identity. Prospective recruits may serve in their self-identified gender when they have met the appropriate standards for accession into the military services. This revised policy will also ensure all medically-necessary transition related care authorized by law is available to all Service members and will re-examine all cases of transgender Service members that may be in some form of adverse administrative proceedings. Over the next 60 days, I look forward to working with the senior civilian and military leaders of the Department as we expeditiously develop the appropriate policies and procedures to implement these changes. The United States Armed Forces are in the business of defending our fellow citizens from our enemies, foreign and domestic. I believe we accomplish that mission more effectively when we represent all our fellow citizens. I also believe we should avail ourselves of the best possible talent in our population, regardless of gender identity. We would be rendering ourselves less fit to the task if we excluded from our ranks people who meet our standards and who have the skills and the devotion to serve in uniform. This is the right thing to do. It is also the smart thing to do. Defense Secretary Austin"
